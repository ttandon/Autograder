1673	1	The procedur I think thei should have includ inord for me to replic the experi would be how differ sampl did thei us for each? What tool did thei us to determin the mass.
1674	1	In order to replic thi experiment, you would need to know how mani ml of vinegar thei used, how much distil water to rins the sampl with and how thei obtain the mass of each sample.
1675	1	In order to replic their experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you ar pour into each of the contain as well as what kind of sampl we ar go to measure. It should state specif marble, limestone, wood and plastic. It should also tell us on what the rock sampl will sit on as differ materi mai compromis the results. The last thing that would be need to replic thi experi is to tell us what kind of contain the sampl should be put in such as wooden boxes,glass test tubes,ziploc bag etc.
1676	1	Pleac a simpl of on materi into on contain and label it. Repeat with remain sampl place a singl sampl into a singl container.
1677	1	Determin the mass of four differ sampl marble, limestone, wood, plastic. Thei all have start mass and end mass, and the diffrence. The wood ha the most mass but marbl ha the most diffrenc in mass.
1678	1	In order to repeat the experi you would need to know what you ar test for. Thei never sai the reason for the experi you need to know how much vinegar thei used, becaus that should be the same for each container. Also in their procedur thei dont tell what the sampl aren't. If you onli had the procedur and not the graph, you wouldnt be abl to replic is becaus you dont know what thei were test in the vinegar.
1679	1	To replic thi experi you would need four new samples. You would also need more vinegar and new contain to do the experi in.
1680	1	"After read the procedure, there is a lot more inform that thei need in order to replic thi experiment. Thei should sai how much vinegar to put into the contain and which contain to put it in. Thei should be more specif when state how thing should be measur by sai 'measur mass on a tripple-beam balance"" etc."
1681	1	After read the group' procedures, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar in each container. Thi import becaus it could affect how much of the sampl is dissolved. I would also need to know were to store the contain in a cold or hot room with light or dark. Also I would need to know the formula for find the differ incas I didn't know. It is a common error to subtract the wrong masses. Finally, I would need to know how long to rins each sampl and whether to dry the sampl under light or not.Thi would affect it weight.
1682	1	After read the group procedure, I would need to know the name of the three sampl be test in the experiment. The amount of the sampl be pour into the contain would also be necessari as well as the amount of distil water be us to rins each sample. Another import factor would be to know the locat of sampl were place in to sit and dry for 30 minutes. How the student record the mass would also be need to replic the experiment.
1683	1	In order to replic thi experi I would need to determin the mass and then label each of the four containers. I would also need to put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last addit chang I would do is to clean up, gather my materi first, and then determin which materi is right for solv my problem.
1684	1	What the hypothesi is/what thei ar try to prove. How much vinegar is need and ad to each sample. What can be us as a constant?
1685	1	After read the group procedure, the addit inform I conclude, that thei need for me to replic the experi is, where do you put the sampl when you replac them from the contain and how to determin the mass.
1686	1	To replic the group' experiment, the procedur would have to state how much vinegar wa pour into the containers. Also, thei should specifi what kind of contain thei were us as thi could affect the results. In the procedure, thei also fail to tell what 4 sampl were us in the experiment, a kei variabl to it' success.
1687	1	Some inform that I would need to replic the experi ar a list of the materi Id need to know how to determin the mass, becaus those thing ar not state in the procedure.
1688	1	To replic thi experi the person would need to state how much vinegar to use, how thei re go to determin the mass of the end and how long to rins of the sampl with water.
1689	1	Informat that would be requir to replic the experi would be the amount of vinegar to be pour in each container, the size or amount of each sampl of material, and where to store the sampl when thei ar dry from the vinegar.
1690	1	The student should have state in the hypothesi that thei predict and correct or not. Also thei should have ad what could'v went wrong in the experi and what should thei have work on to make better.
1691	1	In the procedure, there is not enough inform for someon to replic thi experiment. The procedur should includ namingin four sampl that need to be determin and how much vinegar need to be pour in the containers. The student should also state what thei will be measur when determin the mass. These three thing could improv the procedur of the experiment.
1692	1	One piec of inform that I would add is how much vinigar to us in each container. The 2nd piec I would add is how big the contain should be. A third piec of inform that I would add to thi experi is to tell the person to mark all the inform down into a nice organ table.
1693	1	For me to be abl to replic thi experiment, i would just have to follow the procedur over again.For example, i would have to determin the mass of all four samples. Next i would pour the vinegar in each of four separ contain and act.
1694	1	Addition inform you would need in order to replic the experi is you would need to know the data collect from before. Another thing you would need is to know the collect information, on last and final thing you would need to know is what happen after the next befor have it out for 30 mins. What wa in the when you pill it out.
1695	1	In thi experi I would also includ how it look after 24 hour why the mass went down and why you would put the sampl to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1696	1	You would need a list of thing to get supplies. Those would includ such thing as a scale, cup the samples, vinegar and distil water. Another thing need wa the name of the sampl themselv in the question. And there is no reason or problem stated.
1697	1	In order to replic the experiment, you would need to know what the sampl you'r us are. In step 1, it sai to determin the mass of four differ samples. Also, in step 3 it tell you to place each sampl in a differ container. However,y ar never told what the sampl ar that you ar using.
1698	1	In order to replic the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar wa us in the containers. I would need to know thi becaus if I just pour vinegar into four cups, the amount would be differ and it could chang the result of my expierement.
1699	1	Any addit inform need to replic thi experi would be how much vinegar to us so there ar same amount in each container, how much water to rins 4 with becaus to littl might not wash off all the vinegar and to much might wash off some of the materi and affect the final mass, also student mai need to know what unit to measur the materi in. So thei can get almost exactli what the other group got.
1700	1	To replic thi experi I would need to find out what kind of contain I need. I would also need to know what to put the sampl on to sit and dry. Final I would need to find out what the student us to obtain the mass of the samples.
1701	1	The procedur is veri unclear. In order to replic thi experiment, the procedur must be more specific, for example, instruct must be made about; how much vinegar must you pour into the containers, what kind of contain should be used, specifi what the four sampl ar in the procedure.
1702	1	In order to replic the experiment, you need to add to the procedure. First, you'd need to know what four sampl to use, how much of the sampl to use, how much vinegar to add to the sample, decid what contain to put the sampl in and how much distil water is us to rins the sample.
1703	1	To be abl to separ thi experiment, their need to be more inform in the procedure. The student should be specifi for amount of vinegar ad to the samples. The student should'v ad that the experi should be repeat to be sure the result were correct. The last thing that wa miss from the procedur is a list of the four sampl be used.
1704	1	In order to replic thi experi thei must suppli more specif inform for example,thei should list the four differ sampl names. Second thei should give the size of the container. Last, thei must specifi how much vinegar and the possibl strength of that vinegar.
1705	1	After read the group procedure, inform that need to be includ is, tell what thei ar take sampl of. Another thing thei should includ to how much vinegar thei ar mix with each sample. The final thing thei should includ is about how much of each sampl to use. Those would be need to replic the experiment.
1706	1	Well, the procedur doe not state what the four sampl ar and you need to know that in order to do anything. You also need to know how much vinegar should be used. And you would need to know whether the sampl ar place into the same contain as the on with vinegar.
1707	1	You would need to know how much vinegar you need to put into each container. You need to have a control sample. After wash the sample, do you put it back into the container?
1708	1	Give the amount of each sampl need for the experi have the amount of vinegar need to the experiment. Give the amount of freeli to rins and how long do vari and should the all same time and what temperatur wa the water.
1709	1	To replic thi experiment, I would need to know what the control was. If there even wa on to begin with. The measur for the vinegar and amount of each materi place in the vinegar ar also left out. The name of the materi should also be mention in the procedure.
1710	1	After read the group' procedur the addit inform need to replic the experi would be the differ sampl used. How much vinegar is go to be pour into each of the contain and what should the contain be labled.
1711	1	In order for me to replic the experiment, I would need o know how much, vinegar to pour in each cup, and how much f on substance. Without do that it can effect each substanc differently.
1712	1	The procedureshould explain what the sampl are. The procedur should sai to calcul the differ in mass of each substance. The procedur should explain how much vinegar to use.
1713	1	Some addit informatio would of bee what four exampl should we whaz or what ad vinegar to the sampl as get to do.
1714	1	In order to replic thi experi on would need to know what materi the sampl ar made of. Step number three would need to be revis to sai that each sampl ha it' own cup of vinegar. Also an amount of vinegar wa not determined. A constant start mass should have been us between the four materi becaus the vinegar mai have ecod more of on materi due to a larger amount of surfac area.
1715	1	Some addit inform that you would need to replic thi experi would be thing like the mass of each of the sampl befor thei were put in the vinegar. The temperatur of the vinegar when it wa put in the cup with the samples, the size of the contain that the sampl and solut were in and the amount of vinegar that thei put in the cups, and also weather thei did multipl trail or not.
1716	1	You would need the nishpop and you would need to know were thei got the number from.
1717	1	How much vinegar do you put into the containers. Take out materials. Determin the mass with a tripl beam balance.
1718	1	To replic thi experi I need to know the materi and how to find the mass becaus on cannot assum that anoth person know what thei ar doing.
1719	1	At least includ three piec of inform in order to replic the experiment. The procedur ar determin the mass of four deffer samples. Pour vinegar in each of four separ but ident containers, place a sampl of on materi into on contain and label. Repeat with remain sampl place a singl sampl into a singl contain after 24 hours, remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water. Determin the mass of each sample.
1720	1	In the procedur it should state how to determin the mass of each material. Also it should state the amount of vinegar pour into the container.
1721	1	Three piec of inform need to replic the experi are: (1) Amount of vinegar pour into the containers. (2) Size of sampl (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) and (3) How much distil water is us to rins the samples.
1722	1	To replic thi experiment, it would be import to know how much vinegar should be pour into the four contain in step 2. Thi is unclear, therefor the amount of vinegar should be specified. Next, the group should specifi how much a singl sampl is. The sampl should be constant, therefor result ar comparable. The group should decid on a certain mass sampl to us for the four materials. Lastli to replic thi experi I would need to know how much distil water to rins the sampl with. Right now thi inform is vague.
1723	1	"In order to replic thi experiment, I believ that the group need to includ more inform on the sample. Thei need to sai where the sampl ar be store dure the 24 hour and at what temperature. Base on thi given information, the could be locat outdoor or indoor where the temp would effect the rock sample. Also, thei must includ the amount of vinegar us in the container. Thei simpli tell us to ""pour vinegar"" but never includ an amount."
1724	1	To determin the mass put what form of weight system your weigh it on gram pound etc...When pour the vinegar put what you'll be measur Witer ,ml, liter etc be none describt when label samples.
1725	1	You would need to know how much vinigar to put in. You would need to know what the group is testing. You would also need to know what the group is test for, what is their statement ?
1726	1	Some addit inform that i would need is I wa to replic thi experi is what sampl to get. Thei would need to sai we got all four sampl then heat them. Another piec of inform that I mai need is to find out the differ in mass from befor and after the experiment. And last is to have a step that sai to releas the scale so that the mass can be removed.
1727	1	In order to replic thi experi the procedur would need to includ the amount of vinegar us in each cup. We would also need to know what the sampl ar while the data tabl identifi them, it is not clear from the procedur what we ar testing. Also, we would need to know exactli what it is were testing. The procedur should includ someth about record the start mass, end mass, and the differ in mass.
1728	1	In order to replic the expiment, you must have to mention the four type of samples. List the mass and after you have, you see the differ in mass and doubl with the inform of the result of the mass.
1729	1	The Addition inform i would need in other to replic the experi is to name the sampl that i would have us in the expeement.
1730	1	I would add how much vinegar is be ad to the four containers. I would also add more sampl to the lab. And I would repeat the lab again to see if I get the same answers.
1731	1	The first thing I would have to know is. What ar my sampl go to be of? I would also want to know how much vinegar I'm suppos to pour in each container. I also would need to know what type of contain I'm to store the sampl in.
1732	1	1. Determin the mass of four differ samples; marble, limestone, wood and plastic ^p 2. Pour 20ml of vinegar in each of four seperate, but ident beakers. ^p 3. Place a sampl of on materi into on contain and label. Repeat with remain samples, place a singl sampl into a singl contain place all of contain in the same place.
1733	1	You would also need beaker and test tube and a timer.
1734	1	You would need to know how much vinegar need for each container, also how big the contain ar that you need to put the materi in to ensur that thei fit. The placement of the contain is import becaus if thei ar left in the sun when thei shouldn't be, it could chang the results. How much distil water on need to put into each contain is import to know too.
1735	1	Besid know the procedure, in order to replic thi experi I would have to know what the problem is that we ar try to solve. That way, I could make sure I am come up with the right inform to answer the problem. Another piec of inform I would have to know is if there is a control group. Thi is becaus if there wa one, I could compar my data from the differ sampl to the control group. Also I would have to know what the control variabl ar becaus if all of the variabl that need to be control ar not that my inform would not be as valid as it could be.
1736	1	To replic thi experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to add in each contain and how big each containers. It also doesn't let you know how big each sampl should be or what type of material. Plu it should remind peopl to wear goggl and clean up their area.
1737	1	The addit inform that I would need to replic the experi would be the amount of vinegar that wa pore into each container, the temperatur of vineger, how long and visar the sampl should be rinsed, number of trials, type of contain the sampl should be place in, and what type of equip should be us to determin the mass.
1738	1	In order to replic thi experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar pour in the four containers.
1739	1	You wouldn't need ani addit information. That prscjar wa correct and could be duplic the wai it is present in the procedure.
1740	1	What kind of vinegar,how much vinegar,what kind of surround do you dry the samples.
1741	1	After read thi group procedur i would need to know how mani unit of vinegar should be ad to each cup, which sampl to test, not what the start mass for each sampl should be these three factor were left out and these factor ar vital to the experiment.
1742	1	In order to replic the experi the student should add more procedures. Thei would doubl the hour to see what would happen. Repeat the experi and not rins the sampl with distil water. And don't dry the samples.
1743	1	To replic thi experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar wa us for the sampl to sit in. We would also need to know what the sampl were that we were test in order for the experi to work. And we would also need to know that we should be record all of the data that we were collecting. We would also need to know that we should subtract the differ in mass to be abl to compar the results.
1744	1	The addit inform you will need is at the end sai to record what you have found out. Also I would sai ha with distil water to us to us plan' ruin anything.
1745	1	1. The amount of metrial that you need.^p 2.How much vinegar do you pour.
1746	1	The addit inform need would be if there wa a constant variable. If there wa a certain temperatur that the sampl sat in and how thei got the differ in mass.
1747	1	I think that I would need the time becaus I guess thei have to take the time and I also think that I need the measur of the four mass samples. And how big were the materials.
1748	1	I would need to know what four differ sampl to use, what kind of contain to put them in and I would also need to know how to find the mass of each of the sampl after thei dried. Without thi information, I could not replic thi lab.
1749	1	The procedur need to state what sampl to us instead of ask the reader refer to the data. For exact data. The procedur must also state how much vinegar to use. Also, step three doesn't state whether or not to put the sampl in the water but separ contain as the vinegar.
1750	1	Need to know how much weight of the sampl to start with, how much acid rain should be put in the test tubes.
1751	1	In order to replic thi experi I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. Thi would allow the experi to work adiguity. If on contain had more vinagar than the other then the experi would fail.
1752	1	When the procedur sai pour vinegar in each contain you don't know how much vinegar to put in.Also when it sai place a sampl of on material, I don't know how much that is to put in the container. It also doesn't sai how big the contain ha to be.
1753	1	The I.V.,D.V.,control variables, and constant variabl must be includ in the procedure.
1754	1	In order to make thi experi replic you would need to be more specific. For step number three it should clarifi which sampl and how much of it to place in the container. Thei should add a step between three and four sai where to place. He sampl for 24 hour for the last step thei should explain how to determin the mass by us a tripl beam balance.
1755	1	One thing that would be help to be abl to replic thi experi would be to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain and how big the contain are. Thei should have also told us what the materi were that thei were using, and how much of it to use. Another thing that should have been includ wa how thei ar go to determin the mass of everything.
1756	1	1.You would need to know the four type of sampl in thi experiment. ^p 2.You need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four containers. ^p 3.You need to know what temperatur to have the sampl in, (room warm, cold).
1757	1	To replic the experimenty, you would need to know the amount of vinegar place in each container. You would also need to know the temperatur at which the contain were stored. In addit you would need to know what materi the sampl were.
1758	1	In order to replic the experi the addit inform I would need to know is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. I would need to know how long I should rins the sampl with distil water. I would also need to know how thi group determin the mass of each samp in order to replic the experiment.
1759	1	In order to replic the experiment, you would need to knowhow much vinegar wa used, to see if that plai a major factor on the differ in mass. Also you need to know how much distil water is us to rins off each sample, becaus the water mai wear awai the sample. Even more lastly, youone to know what your measur the mass with.
1760	1	In order to replic the experiment, the addit inform you would need is what the sampl were, how much vinegar wa put into the contain and also the temperatur of what thei ar go to put the containers, becaus whether vinegar mai us more acidic.
1761	1	After read thi procedure, I have figur out that you would need to know the type of the contain used, weather or not thei wer test tubes, beakers, etc. Also, you would need to know how much of each sampl you would need, in oz, kg, g, etc. Finally, you would need to know how much vinegar to us in l, ml, etc.
1762	1	Addition inform you would need in order to replic the experi is the data tabl that wa record start the into on each sample. Informat such as the sampl start to end mass and differ is veri import to understand becaus it is need to understand the result of the experiment.
1763	1	First I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain second I would need to know what the, size of each sampl need to be. Then I have to know how much acid is in the water.
1764	1	You would not need ani other inform to replic the experi thei tell you how long to put the sampl in the vinegar, how to rins them, how big to let them sit. But on thing is how much vinegar did thei us in each container.
1765	1	The addit inform that I would add is how much vinegar in each contain I would also add a purpos of the experiment. After mass the sampl on step 6, determin the sampl differ in befor and after weight.
1766	1	After read the group procedure, some inform that thei would need in order to replic the experi would be to measur out how much liquid vinegar thei us for each sample, and then measur it again after thei take the centiment ar to measur it.
1767	1	Well after read the group procedure, I reliz that the addit inform thei need to give you is how much vinegar to pour into the four separ but identical, containers. The group doe not show that the sampl sat for 24 hour then thei remov the sampl and rins each sampl with distil water.Also how do I know like where I am suppos to dry them in a windowsil in the cup, in a microwave, or just to let it sit there till it drys.
1768	1	The three most import piec of info that would need to replic thi experi is to determin the mass of the diiffer samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but ident containers, and after 24 hour resum the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water.
1769	1	To replic thi experi I would need to know how much vinegar wa used, What sae wa the contain that held the vinegar, and what temperatur the contain where kept at dur the 24hrs.
1770	1	Addition inform that I would need in order to replic the experi are, what ar the 4 differ sampl that I would be testing, what size contain would I need and how much vinegar do I use.
1771	1	"In step one, the procedur need to explain what four materi ar be tested. It is not specif enough by just sai ""four differ sample"". In step 2, the procedur should state how much vinegar need to be ad to each container. The reader ha no wai of know thi information. ^p The procedur sai that the contain should each be labeled, but it doe not explain how thei should be labeled, or what thei should say. In order to be abl to replic thi experiment, that must be clarified."
1772	1	Some of the thing that you would need inabl to repeat thi experi is, tell you what sampl thei ar using. All thei sai is, get the mass of four differ samples, don't state what thei are. Also how much vinegar is be ad to the containers. Thei did not sai what amount of vinegar thei put in. The last thing is that,
1773	1	"To replic the experiment, you would need to know what the ""samples"" mention in step 1 are. Thi way, there would be no confus as to what materi you ar work with. Also, you would need to know what kind of contain the ""samples"" ar kept in. Lastly, in order to properli replic the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container."
1774	1	I would need to know how the sampl look in the procedure. I feel like thi becaus i alreadi knoxw starting, end and differ in all mass. To do the difference, i would have to kneew how it wa do threw the procedures.
1775	1	After read thi group procedure, I decid that it would need more inform in order for me to accur replic in on thing. I thought it would need be a given amount of vinegar to be put in each cue, like 63 ml for example. I also thought that the name of the sampl (marble, limestone, wood and plastic ) should be given, for without them, I would not know I wa testing. Lastly, I would includ a final step thu told the sender to determin the differ between the start and ind mass, so that the reader know where to go next.
1776	1	One would need to know how much vinegar went into each container. One would also need to know how the sampl were and their masses.
1777	1	First the group should tell how much of the vinegar to us Also thei should sai how much vinegar the experi need to be done. Final thei should tell you what in the materi be weight on.
1778	1	There ar three piec of inform you might need to replic thi experiment. The first is how much vinegar to us in each container. A second would be the type of condit the contain wa place in over night becaus thing like light might caus a faster or more effect reaction on the samples. Third, you would need to know in what form the sampl are. The marbl or limeston could be in small rock form as oppos to all solid block which mai caus the reaction to have a differ outcome.
1779	1	Thi group should for scientif verification, repeat I the experi at least twice. Thei should also specifi the amount of vinegar in each container. The group should have had a control to contrast their findings.
1780	1	You would need to know how much vinegar you would put in each container. And also, you'd have to make sure that you put equal amount into each container, or els you would find an number of error in the experiment.
1781	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Also, I would need to know how much distil water I would need to rins each sample, and for how long.
1782	1	Determin the mass of four differ samples. Place a sampl of on materi into on contain and label. Repeat with remain samples, place a singl sampl into a singl container. Determin the mass of each sample. Allow the sampl to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1783	1	In order to repeat thi experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar wa put into each of the four samples. Thi would be essenti for us to repeat the experi step by step. It would also be help to determin how much of each sampl to put in each container. And finally, in order to repeat thi experiment, we would also have to do anoth trial and probabl includ a control variabl to repeat thi experi exactli like the group of students.
1784	1	To replic the experi by just read the procedur I would need to know how much vinegar wa pour onto the sampl and affect the mass, also what type & size the contain wa becaus that would affect the concentr of the vinegar and also what materi the sampl were at the type of environ (temperature, brightness) thei were left in for the 24 hour period becaus that would also affect the end result.
1785	1	In order to replic thi experiment, addit inform should be added. For example, the procedur should explain what type of sampl to use, includ the number of tool that ar need and how much of an object or sampl you need. After ad these procedures, a person would be abl to repeat thi experiment.
1786	1	Some inform need to replic thi procedur would be the temperatur that thi experiment. Another piec of inform would be a graph. And lastli would be a better explanation.
1787	1	You would need to know how much vinegar wa put in each of four separ containers. Did you remov the sampl from the contain and rins the sampl with distil water? Also how long did you let the sampl sit and dry?
1788	1	In order to replic the experiment, what will be need is the depended, independ and the control, which ar vinegar, the contain and the time to each sample.
1789	1	To replic thi procedure, inform such as how much vinegar to pour into the contain as instruct in step 2 , what materi were us in step 3, or how much of the materi wa used, also in 3 would be crucial.
1790	1	-What temperatur (environment) should the contain be place it. Cold? Hot? Room temp? ^p -After 24 hour do you need glove and or goggl to work with thi sampl ? ^p -Where could 2 find marbl and limestone?
1791	1	In order to replic thi experi I need to know specif what sampl thei ar talk about, what type of control to us in thi experi and how much vinegar to pour in each container. I would also be us to know if when store the sampl for 24 hours, if thei should be in a certain temperatur (room temp,high temp, or low temp. etc).
1792	1	The student should have included. how thei determin the mass of the four sampl in step 1 or 6.Thei also need to includ how much vinegar thei pour in the contain as well as how much water thei us to rins the samples, or how long thei rins them.
1793	1	A group os student idid a scienc project call acid pain had to determin four differ samples. The put the four differ sampl which is marble, limestone, wood and plastic in four differ cup filler with vinegar and afther 24 hour rins the exampl and dry them for 30 minut and see what is the mass afther everi sampl loss mass expect for wood. I had the same mass afther it wa measured.
1794	1	I think the group should mention how much vinegar thei ar us for measurements. And thei should includ to record data procedur should be writen more clearli it would be hard to do thi lab look at thi procedur thei gave us.
1795	1	In order to replic thi experiment, on would need much more information. Firstly, step 2 sai to pour vinegar into four containers. In order to replic the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each. I would also need to know how much of the four differ sampl (marble, limestone, wood and plastic) to use. Also, in step 5 it sai to let the sampl sit and dry for 30 mins. I would need to know if I should let them dry at room temp, in a cold location, in a sunni spot etc.
1796	1	After read the group procedur some peic of inform you would need to replic the expieri is the sampl like marble, limeston and wood.
1797	1	I think you will need a bottl of vinegar,a contain cabels, temer, paper, a manole, a cemenstone, wood and a plastic. You will need..
1798	1	In order to replic the experi you will need to know how much vinger to pour into the samples. You will also need to know what ar the four samples. You will also need to know constent & controls. The procedur need to be made clear.
1799	1	You would need to know the contain size, and what you measur the sampl with
1800	1	Step one:pour a vinegar in four ident containers. ^p Step two:Plac a meteri in each contain and label it. ^p Step three:After 24 hour remov the materi and rins it out with water. ^p Step four:Allow the sampl to dry for 30 minut and determin the mass.
1801	1	In the procedur thei did not tell the sample' that thei wa do to be testing. Also didn't tell us what mass wa when thei start and when thei wa finish what wa the mass. Last thei didn't tell us that thei need to find the differ in mass.
1802	1	"In order to correct the error in thi experiment, some few thing need to be changed. Firstly, the procedur never mention record your data; thi need to be part of the procedure. Secondly, the procedur states, ""determin the mass."" It is not explain how to do so and what to use. Thirdly, the procedur never tell what sampl ar or what to label them as in the experiment. Thi is extrem import becaus the peopl do the experi need to know what thei ar work with."
1803	1	Their ar three thing that i would need to know to repeat the procedure. The first thing is in their procedur thei do not mention the four samples. Another thing is the procedur doe not state the pH of the vinegar. Also thei do not repeat the process for greater validity. Another thing is it serv wai to setup the content in the procedure.
1804	1	"In order to replic the experi I would need to know, first, what were the sampl when thei just said ""sample"" If I don't know thetyp of thesampl then how wa I suppos to test for anything, I also would need to know what type of contain thei were talleg about wer thei us for small graduat cylind or were or were thei us a 50 gallon unit. Finally, I would need to know thei amounts, I need the amount of the samples, the vinegar, and the distil water."
1805	1	Addition inform I would need in order to replic the experi is what materi I would need for thi experiment, the amount I'm support to pour in the contain and what ar the samples.
1806	1	How much vinegar thei ar pour in to each sample.
1807	1	In order to replic thi experi I would need the follow information. First I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. Second, I would need to find out the exact size of of four ident containers. Final I would need to know the temperatur at which the four materi sat for 24 hours, becaus the temperatur of the solution/room could affect the results.
1808	1	I would need toknow: How much vinegar to put in each container, How to weigh the mass of the doyeds, how big of the object do I need.
1809	1	"In order to replic thi experiment, I'll need more information. If I want to find the chang in mass of the four samples, I would'v had each sampl weigh the same at the begin of the experiment. Also to make thi lab more correct, all of the sampl should have the same amount of vinegar in them. Lastly, in order to make the lab more correct, I would put the exact step in the procedure. Instead of sai ""repeat"", it'd be better, and easier if it said exactli what to do."
1810	1	In order to repeat hi group' procedur you must have the same amour of mass of each cup. Place the same materi into the same on it had (the mass amount). Then procead with the same thing that you did with the last one. Sit for 24 hour then rinc with distil water.
1811	1	To replic the expeirment, you would need to know the purpose. Know the purpos of the expeir allow the person to know what to look for or to expect. You would also need to know what type of contain to do the expeir in so the experi doesn't go wrong. You would need to know where to remov the sampl into after taken out of their containers. You would also need to know what to do with the contain afterwards.
1812	1	In order to replic thi experiment, you need to explain why the sampl loss mass, what caus it to loss it host or why did it stai the same. Yo also need to tell us what you saw,show us what happen when the sampl were loss it mass. Mayb you need to try chemic on the sampl besid vinegar.
1813	1	The group would need to state how much vinegar wa in each container. Thei would need to state how long to rins each contain with distil water. Thei would need to identifi what the four sampl ar in the procedure, and to sai to record the data.
1814	1	you would need to know how much venegar to put in. A;so the strength of vinegar( if there is a difference) .Where should the contain so far the of have i. in a everi regardless, room temperatur
1815	1	You would need: ^p 1)Conclus about how you did everything. ^p 2)Result of how everyth came out as you wanted. ^p 3)Informat about the procedures.
1816	1	I think that you should start each sampl with the same amount of mass, so that your result will be more accurate. Also instead of write the differ thei should have record the final result to make it less confusing.
1817	1	In order to replic thi experi I would need to know how to determin the mass. Just state 'determin the mass' doe not tell me how to. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the contain to make the data accur and constant. I would need to know where to dry the sampl would thei need to be in the sun, shade, etc.
1818	1	In order to replic the expir we would need amount of vinegar used, size of contain us and how much distil water wa us for rinsing.
1819	1	Addition inform need to replic the experi would be a more specif descript of mass, and how much mass you ar us what kind of contain need to be us and what size.
1820	1	Thei should have done more tests. Thei also should have wrote what the expera wa about.
1821	1	In order to replic thi experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that is to be pour into each container. You would also need to know the amount of distil water the contain ar to be rins with and what qualiti a sampl to be the most efficient.
1822	1	I would need to know what sampl wa put in each container. Also how much vinegar wa pour into each container.
1823	1	You would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, as well as the size and shape of each container. You would also want to know the type of vinegar used, all three of the factor ar import to insur consist and increas validity.
1824	1	To be abl to replic thi problem you would have to know how much vinegar is go into each container. Also why thei ar perform the experi what the problem is what ar the differ samples.
1825	1	There ar sever piec of inform miss from thi procedure. First, it is import to know in the procedur that the sampl ar marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Thi inform is not given until the data table, also, the procedur doe not specifi how much vinegar should be pour into the containers. Finnally, it is necessari to know how much of each sampl materi should be ad to the contain with vinegar. With thi information, replic the experi would be much easier.
1826	1	The addit inform is how ar we suppos to measur the mass of the object, thei need a indenp varibl and I need to then the control.
1827	1	The addit inform need is: ^p -Name the specif sampl us in the procedur ^p -Sai how much vinegar on need to pour into contain ^p -Should the sampl sit in light, dark area or cover ?
1828	1	Some inform that you would need is the amount of vinegar you should pour into theseper containers. Second of all we should also know how long we rins the sampl for. Finally, we need the previou result to compar data.
1829	1	Addition inform need to be ad to thi procedur thei need to put gather materi for step one. Thei need to tell exactli what sampl (rocks). Thei need to add the amount of vinigar thei ar go to pour in. Thei need to make the last sentenc in step three a separ step. Thi procedur wa not carefulli organized.
1830	1	What the group forgot to do wa tell the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. The group also forgot to includ whether or not if thei need to cover each container. Thei forgot to tell what metric unit to measur the materi with which wa grams.
1831	1	In order to replic thi acid rain experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to us sinc it should remain a constant. Also how big each sampl is, result will not be accur if the sampl ar not similar in size. Also all sampl should be kept at the same temperatur in the same area so thei ar not affect differently.
1832	1	The group could have told how much vinegar, the acual size of the contain thei us and the size if all the samples. For example, how lang wa the piec of wood? Would size make a differ in the end mass and the calcul of the differ in mass.
1833	1	In thi tabl it' sai that first when start mass that time marbl wa 9.8 then it' decreas it would 9.4. So it' decreas -0.4. In limeston the mass is decrea too. First, start mass is 10.4 and then end mass is 9.1. It' differ beetween -1.3. In wood no change. In start mass it wa 11.2 and end mass it would 11.2 too. So it' in no change. In plastic start mass is 7.2 and end mass is 7.1. It is decreases. It' in differ beetween -0.1. I think wood is not heavi then other that' why it' in no change. Then limeston It' in big chang to other becaus it' heavi them other.
1834	1	In order to replic the experiment, on would need to know what wa in each of the four samples. Also on must know how much vinegar to pour into each sample. You would also have to know which sampl of materi wa place in which container.
1835	1	You would need to includ what the sampl ar of. You would need to includ where to record data. Finally, you would also need to know if the mass of each sampl should be the same. Without those bit of information, it would be difficult to replic the experiment.
1836	1	In order to replic the group experiment, I would need to see a few more piec of inform in their procedure. Firstly, I would need to know what type of sampl to use. I can see what sampl the group us by look at their data table, but I would want to know if I had to us the same ones. Also, I would have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, becaus my result could chang if I us a differ amount of vinegar than the group did. Depend on the amount of vinegar I use, the third thing I would need to know is how big the sampl should be. If it is import for the vinegar to cover the sample, the procedur should tell me that so I don't make the sampl too big.
1837	1	To replic the experiment, addit inform would includ new loco 10 wait befor try the experi again.It should ar state how much of the sampl ar bein put into the contain and how long the sampl should be rins for.
1838	1	Addition inform that would need ar to list what ar the differ sampl be us
1839	1	In order to replic thi procedur I would need to know what the materi were,th size of the material, and how much vinegar wa in each container.
1840	1	Thi isn't a clear statement. Use to thi expir the problem would explain why the student were conduct thi expir in the first place.
1841	1	The addit inform that you would need in order to replic the experi would be know what the solut ar such as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You need to be more specif so the reader can complet do the experi by themselv without ask questions.
1842	1	To replic the experiment, I would need to know what safeti precaut I should be take the exart amount of vinegar to pour into each container, and where the sampl should be kept dure the 24 hour thei ar in the container.
1843	1	The person conduct the experi would have to know what the sampl were; the procedur didn't includ that knowledge. Another piec of inform that would be need to repeat the experi would be how much vinegar is us for each sampl and is the amount kept constant. The last piec of inform that is need is what safeti equip should be used; safeti procedur ar often includ in the experiment' procedure.
1844	1	"There is some addit inform need to replic the thi experiment. For example, the procedur doe not sai how much vinegar to use. It also just sai ""samples"" and doesn't specifi what the sampl ar of. The procedur also doe not tell us what type of contain to us or sai to record your data."
1845	1	If I were to rewrit the procedur I would incud what the sampl were. Also I would includ how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers.
1846	1	In order to replic the group' experiment, on must know the amount of vinegar us on each of the samples. Also, what type and the amount of sampl is needed. In addition, know the purpos of the lab would be highli benefiti so that on know what to test for. It' imperit to add the amount of sampl and the amount of vinegar inord to perform the experi in all exactness. Otherwise, on might receiv not onli differ but in accur data.
1847	1	The student need to be more specific. Thei need to state how much vinegar to pour into each of the 4 cups. Second, thei never said what unit or never said when to record the data. Lastli thei need to state how much distil water.
1848	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the cups. You would also need to know how long to rise the sampl with distil water.
1849	1	Addition inform that would be need is the initi amount of vinegar, then the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours, and then the differ in the volume. If I had those three piec of info, I would be abl to replic the experi and possibl compar answers.
1850	1	Addition inform need to replic
1851	1	To follow thi group procedur I would have to be more detailed, like instead of sai sampl all the wai through the procedur it would have been better if thei the four thing that thei were test in it would be less confusion. In step two it would have been much better thei just made it less complic and sad place the marble, limestone, wood, and plant sampl into their own seper ident contain and label them. It would have been good to ,explain why thei were told to find the mass of their samples.
1852	1	The inform you would need in order to replic thi experi would be the four differ samples, the start , end and differ in mass, you would need the four sampl ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) becaus that' what the experi is on. You would need the start mass, end mass and the differ in mass becaus that' how your do the experiment.
1853	1	In order to replic thi experiment, you would also want to test all these four sampl in water as a control, in the same exact procedure. Furthermore, it is also import to retest thi experi under a constant like room temperatur to make sure it is not a variabl in the results. Lastly, to replic thi experiment, you would need to know the chemic in acid rain and chemic composit of vinegar to see if thei corrol and that thi experi is a good represent of what happen wi acid rain.
1854	1	After read the group procedure, I would need to know what sampl were used. If I did not us the same sampl my experi could come out differently. I would also need to know what unit to weigh the mass in. If I weigh it differ we could get differ results. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain that could affect the outcom of my experiment.
1855	1	To replic the experiment, on would need to know what the ''samples'' were. Without thi information, it would be imposs to do the experiment. One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to each container- thi could effect the outcom of the experiment. In addition, on would need to know the temperatur of the vinegar which could also effect the outcom of the experiment.
1856	1	Addition inform that you might need in order to replic the experi is to conduct a hypothesi you will need to get organ and gather all inform to be abl to perform a conclus in the end with the information.
1857	1	1) I would need to know which type of materi to us for the samples. ^p 2) I would need to know how much vineagar to put in each containar. ^p 3) I would need to know the approxim size of the samples.
1858	1	One addit inform need would be how to determin the mass of each sample. How much vinegar would be put in to each of the containers. How big would the contain need to be.
1859	1	You would need to sai what differ sampl you had in the experiment. Where would you put them over night. How big would the contain be for the samples.
1860	1	Addition data that I would need in order to replic thi experi is the amount of vinegar that wa ad into the contain becaus if on sampl measur more or less than another, the data mai also bear altered.I would also need to know the size or the contain us and what type of unit thei were measur with. Lastli to be abl to replic thi experiment. One would also need to know the temperatur for everi it' materials. Such as dab and wipe a papa towel or just simpli allow them to sit and dry on a substance.
1861	1	There is not enough inform to be abl to replic the experiment. Firstli thei should state the sampl you need to us in step one. There should also be a control for you to compar it to. The final error is that step 4 is too vague. It sai to remov the sampl but not how to, for exampl with tong or wear plastic gloves.
1862	1	In order to replic thi experi I would need to know the size of each of the samples. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar be used. Last, I would need to know the size of the contain be us and how long to rins the sampl of rock for.
1863	1	Do the experi again but with a differ solution. ^p Let the sampl sit for 48 hours. ^p Instead of sit and dry. Dry the sampl with a paper towel or cloth.
1864	1	The group did not includ the temperatur that thei left the remain samples. Thei also did not includ the amount of vinegar that we should pour in the four separ containers. Also thei should of do the experi more than onc to make sure the answer thei come out with, were alright.
1865	1	The group' procedur need to be more specific. Thei need amount in the procedure. Thei do not tell you how much vinegar is to be poured. Also what is need to determin the mass of the samples. Also the samples, how much of the sampl we need.
1866	1	To replic thi experiment, i would need to know the control of the experiment, what amount of vinegar is pour on sample,what is be test includ independ and depend variade.
1867	1	In order for me to replic thi experi I would need to know how much vinegar I need to pour into each container, if I would need to stabl the mass of the sampl with the vinegar still on it and also ruck at why & am even perform thi experiment.
1868	1	The lab need to includ what sampl ar be ad to the vinegar. Next time the lab should sai that you should place a sampl of marble,limestone, wood and plastic to each vinegar sample.
1869	1	To repeat thi experi thei would need a balenc to measur the mass of each build material. You would also need a graduat cylind to measur out the vinger out. In the experi it doe sai the amount of vinger used.
1870	1	Addition inform that would be need to replic thi experi woold be what type of containers, what type of materials, and lastli how much vinegar should be pour in to each container, becaus it doesn't state these item in their proceduer.
1871	1	You would also need to.
1872	1	In order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar thei put in the containers. You would also have to know how to dry the samples. Then you would have to know how to dry the samples.
1873	1	In order to replic the experi , in the procedur it should sai to write down or mark a chart sai the start mass and end mass and start the experiment. You need to write down thi inform becaus it help to find out the mass of the differ samples.
1874	1	In order to replic the procedure, I would need to know what volum of vinegar to use. I would also need to know what size contain or beaker to use. The procedur should also explain what equip to us when remov the sampl from the contain such as tongs. Lastly, within the procedure, it should state what sampl will be used.
1875	1	The procedur should look like this-1) Determin the mass of 4 differ samples; marble, limestone, water and plastic. 2) Pour 10ml (how much) of vinegar in each 4 separate, but ident containers. 3) Place a sampl of on materi into on contain & label. Repeat w/remain samples, place a singl sampl into a singl contem. After 24 hours, remov the sampl from the contain & rins with distil water for 3 minutes. 5) Allow the sampl to sit & dry for 30 minut at room temperature. 6) Determin the mass of each sampl by subtract the start mass (in grams) from end mass in gram ).
1876	1	In order to replic thi experi I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each cup, so each sampl would be sit in the same amount of vinegar. I would need to know how long to rins the sample: for so thei ar rins an equal amount of time. Also I need to know if each sampl is suppos to wai the same or be the same size.
1877	1	IN the procedure, it didn't tell what the sample' were. Step 2 said to pour vinegar in four indent contain but it didn't tell how much to pour. 1, we don't measur them, we ar go to do the experi wrong. Step 1 could of said record the start mass of each of the four samples; marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1878	1	After read the group' procedure, I believ that I would need the follow inform in order to replic the experiment. I would need the differ type of materi list in the procedure.
1879	1	To do the experiment, you would have to know the start masses, how much vinegar must be ad to each contain and what the sampl materi ar
1880	1	In order to replic the group' procedur you would need to know ^p -How much vinegar should be pour each cup? ^p -What type of contain should be used? ^p -If the contain should be left in the light or dark overnight or it avoid be covered.
1881	1	The pour into the take the vinegar in each containers. ^p who is the problem ( Hypothesis) ^p How you can do thi experi ^p A tabl who explain the experi ^p us more type of mass like glass, paper, etc.
1882	1	One other thing you would need to know is the amount of vinegar place in each container, so all sampl have the same amount. Another thing need to be known is where ar the contain should be place for 24 hours, becaus the amount of sunlight might effect the experiment. Other than than, thi experi is replicable.
1883	1	Addition inform is to includ the sampl name to label them. How much vinegar to us in the contain so the outcom is fair for all samples, and also point out which is the independ variabl and when is the depend variabl and which is the depend variabl to understand the lab better.
1884	1	You would need to tell how much vinegar wa add to each sampl atth start.
1885	1	The procedur need a control for each sampl material. Thi would be done by place each sampl into 4 more contain with no vinegar. to use. The procedur need to sai the amount of vinegar to put into each container. The procedur should also sai specif what four sampl to use.
1886	1	The group should have provid a control so that I could compar my result in it. Thei also should have been more clear about exactli how much vinegar I should put into each container. Each contain should have the same amount , but thei didn't state what that was. The group should have also been more specif about the size of the sampl be experi on. I'm not sure if thei all ar the same or different.
1887	1	It would be best of thei specifi what thei ar sampl in 1 in the procedure. It should sai determin the mass of four differ sampl of material. In step number 2, it sai pour in vinegar but not how much. Thei should li is at someth like 150 ml. For the graph it would be better if there wa a column, where it list the percentag post so that the reader can understand which materi wa effect the mass.
1888	1	After read the group procedure, on would need to know how much vinegar wa put in each container.
1889	1	. Amount of vinegar would be needed. ^p . Purpos of the experi would be needed. ^p . Hypothesi would be needed.
1890	1	In order to replic the experi we need to know how much of the vinegar to poor in each container, we would also need to know unit of measur we ar us to determin the mass, and what the sampl are.
1891	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would need to get an averag for the results. Lastly, you would need to have sampl with the same mass at the start.
1892	1	Some addit inform I would need to replic thi experi ar the name of the differ type of materi so I knew I am testing. The amount of vinegar pour into each contain need to be state on the result will come out accurate. Another part of inform that should have been includ wa a control of just water for each sampl so there is someth to compar the other result to.
1893	1	We would need to have a contini. Also an independ variabl and a depend variable.
1894	1	In order for me to repeat the expiri I would need to know a littl bit more inform such as, how much of each substanc to use, how much vinegar to us and what the temperatur should be when let the sampl out in containers. Thi person ha to be a lot more specif in hi procedur veri hard to follow
1895	1	Thei would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup, what sampl materi would be, determin the temp that the sampl should dry at.
1896	1	The addit inform you would and to replic thi experi is you would need a lot of materials,y would need to see the student observ and you would need to see the conclusion. Bassicali a written lab report would be the best tool in recreat thi experiments.
1897	1	In order for me to replic thi experiment, I need to know how much vinegar do I need to pour in the containers. I need to know what the sampl of the miner ar and I also need to know how I'm go to measur the mass.
1898	1	In order to replic the experi , you will need to record the mass 8 of differ samples. You also need to pour the vinegar into the separ contain you us hea to wait 24 hour ar you have to let the sampl dry for a while , then you determin the mass.
1899	1	Some addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi would alst be to have the same amount of vinegar in each of the sampl cups, to have an equal effect, 2nd would be to have the same amount of the sample, get the same start mass for all 4 so in the end you can us which sampl wa effect the most. Finally, you should subtract the start mass from the end mass to get the differ to see which wa affect most by the substance.
1900	1	In order to replic thi experiment, you would first need to know how much vinegar wa pour into the containers, you would also need to know what temperatur the room thei ar left in , should be overnight and how much distil water to us when rins the samples.
1901	1	How much vinigar is in each container? What type of wood? What is the control?
1902	1	Addition inform need to replic the experi is how much vinegar is pour into the containers. Another piec of inform that is miss is how much is a sampl of each material. Final you would repeat the experi a coupl of time to see if your result change.
1903	1	I wan need to know what sampl to us co i need a graph of some sat to record the start and end mass. What unit of mass do the sampl need to be weigh in.
1904	1	To do replic of the experi you would need measur how much vinegar ar dropping.Th other stone have alreadi been us and cannot be us again. You also need to have a tripl beam balanc to be abl to see how much each stone eventu weighed.Fin you would need to test them what thei need to each sampl for a separ 30 minutes, unless thei all get differ in at the same time.
1905	1	In order to replic the experiment, I need wood, plastic, limestone, marbl and vinegar. Also, I would need water to rins the sampl off with after the 24 hour soak.
1906	1	In order to replic thi experiment, I would need to what the sampl ar that ar using. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four samples. I would also need to know what I must us to take out the sample. would I us my hand or tongs?
1907	1	if I were to replic this, I would need to know how much vinegar thei put in each cup, do you put differ amount in differ cups? Also where should I put the cup to rest, inside, outside? Would that have differen out comes?
1908	1	Thi procedur lack import detail and is not in order. Step on is too similar to step 6. Need to specifi what kind of differ samples, and how to determin the begin mass. Step two need to includ the specif amount of vinegar for each container. The procedur should includ the size need for the sampl to get accur results. Step 3 should state what to label the contain with which information. In step 6, thei should includ how to calcul the mass, for exampl subtract begin mass from end mass. Add, record data results.
1909	1	In order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar wa put into the contain and what type of coma were us to hold the sampl i would also need to know what the purpos of thi experi is in other word what is the group of studen is try to prove?
1910	1	1. How much vinegar do you put into the differ containers. 2. How larg is the sampl be used. ^p 3.The depend or the depend
1911	1	One piec of inform that should be includ is the amount of vinegar necessari in each cup. Also, how the material' mass is determin should be included. Lastly, how big the materi is should be stated.
1912	1	In order to replic the group experiment, I would need the temperatur of the vinegar. The amount of vinegar pour into each contain and the amount of sampl need (how much needed.
1913	1	Some addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is step 1-6 becaus there importan to make the tabl acecit. You woud also need to make other tabl to show you resit and other infomation.
1914	1	The group need to provid how much vinegar is be pour into the containers.Th amount of vinegar can chang the exeperiment.
1915	1	How much vinegar, how big should the contain be and how big should the sampl be ar all addit inform you would need to recreat thi experiment.
1916	1	In order to replic the experi the person mai need a diagram of the experiment. The person need the prombl or statement to determin what thei mayb test for. Also thei need the list of materi thei have to us in order to do the experiment.
1917	1	You will need to explain what is happen with the vinegar. What happen to the sampl after it drys, and what the experi look like
1918	1	Thei need to sai how much vinegar to put in each container. The also need to sai where to put the label on the materi itself, on the cup, or on the tabl in front of the cup. Laslti thei need to sai how to remov the materi from the containers, do thei us their finger or tongs.
1919	1	To replic the experi the group would need to better state the problem. Give an amount of vinegar to put in the contain and lastli us more then on trial.
1920	1	Informat that would be need in the procedur would be the name of the sampl material. Also you'll need when and how to measur the mass of materials. Thi inform is need to replic the experiment.
1921	1	How much vinegar, what kind of scale.
1922	1	To replic thi experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on the rocks, the purpos of thi experiment, and a control variable.
1923	1	Three piec of inform I would need to replic the experi ar vinegar to pour into the containers. A scale to weight the mass and find thediffer at the end of the experi and distil water to rins each sampl with.
1924	1	In thi procedur thei leav out some thing that make it im possibl to recreat quantitys' it sai noth about how much vinegar or rock sam plquantiti also us cleaner number would make iteasy to recreat and read.
1925	1	In order to replic the experi you need to have information. Some exampl of thing you would need to no is how much vinegar is be pour in each of the seper containers. Another thing that you would need to no is the volum of each substanc becaus the surfac area will effect how much is erod off. Another thing where you let the sampl sit for 30 minut becaus there might be differ in temperatur effect how much it drys.
1926	1	The addit inform that need to be includ ar what the sampl are. The amount of vinegar pour into the contain in step 2 also need to be known. Another part that need more inform is how much of each sampl need to be place in the contain in step 3. Another part of thi experi that need more inform is step 2, what type of contain should the sampl be place into.
1927	1	One piec of inform i would need is what ar the four differ samples. Another piec of inform is how much vinegar i need to pour into each container. The third piec of inform i would need is how much and how long should i rins each sampl with distil water. Another piec of inform you could us is at what temperatur condit ar the sampl left to sit and dry in.
1928	1	In order to replic thi group' experiment, you will need top know how much vinegar is be used, how long you rins each sampl and condit the sampl ar dry in.
1929	1	You would need to know what to take sampl of. The procedur isn't specif in what materi ar be weighed. You would also need to know ani safeti procedur to be taken while conduct thi experiment. Also, the procedur doe not give a specif place to leav the containers. Addition the procedur should tell the diment of the sampl so that their volum ar all the same.
1930	1	The addit inform you would need to know is the shape, size, and liquid.
1931	1	To secrefullu replic the procedur I or anybodi els would need the follow information. First a statement that will tell me what. I am do the lala for. Amateri list will also be needed. Last I would need a better procedur that is
1932	1	In order to better replic thi expiriment, the student must also tell us the amount ofvinegar pour into each cup (m/s), the amount of water us to rins the materi (in m/s) and the time given to rins (how long mai each contain rins in water).
1933	1	In the procedur number I doesn't explain what four differ sampl to use. Another thing the procedur could have said wa to list what materi to use. After read thi procedur I would be abl to replic thi experiment. Not know how much vinegar to pour in might mass up thi experiment.
1934	1	Some addit inform thut hei coold put in the data is how much vinegar thei pot in the contain and anoth thing that thei could sai is about the temperatur of the room or the vinegar.
1935	1	The three addit inform that can be ad is the control of the experiment,th student could'v done these with a warm temperatur and on with cold. Lastly,thei could have us regular water than distil water.
1936	1	In order to replic thi experiment. You would need the name of the sampl you must us the measur for the vinegar and the measur (amounts) for each sample.
1937	1	Some addit inform the group could add is how much vinegar your suppos to put in each container. In addition, thi group could also includ the size of the contain they'r using. Final i think thei should have been a littl more specif with their steps.
1938	1	In order to replic thi experi addit inform you would need is, what do you us to measur the mass, tell it in your procedure. Tell the reader how much vinegar to put in each of the contain in step 2. Also tell the reader where do you place the contain after thei have been rinsed' do you place them in a cold area, hot area or room temperature. Thi could mess up the experi if you ar not told this.
1939	1	Identifi what ar the four rock thei ar go to us and if it all differ shapes. Also tell if the contan ar the same size or not?
1940	1	I think that thei need to show how mani cup thei have the amount of vinegar and how much of the materi that thei ar us for there experiment.
1941	1	The addit inform i would need to replic the experiment, i would need to know what the four differ sampl so i can test the same thing. The second to saw vinegar to pour into the contain all the sampl have the same qualiti level. You sai thi is to sai now long tonn earn sampl so the vinegar can wash off.
1942	1	There is a lot of addit inform on would need to repeat thi experiment. First, the student should includ the differ name for the four sampl in order for proper replication. Furthermore, the student should includ the amount of vinegar that should be pour into the containers. The size of the sampl should also be indic in the procedure. Furthermore, it would be best if the size of the contain wa provid in the procedure.
1943	1	Acid rain. ^p Will repeat some samples, make data, and check if the experi is correct.
1944	1	In the procedur it is not includ how thei determin the mass of the sampl or what the sampl were (step 3). Also, it is not state in step 6 how to determin the mass. The temperatur of the distil water is not defin at constant in step 4. The locat or temperatur of the place where the four substanc in step 4 ar not defin nor the temperatur of where thei ar dry in step 5.
1945	1	The addit inform that I would need would be the materials. So that we would know what we need to do the experiment. We need a desk explan as to why we ar determinig the mass of each sample.
1946	1	Addition inform that I would need inord to conduct thi experi is what differ kind of sampl how much vinegar to pour into each cup and also what to label the cup if I dont have ani of thi my experi won't be valid. I need to know the independ and depend variabl and what ha to be constant. Another thing is what ar we us to weigh the sampl with.
1947	1	You would need to know what you ar us what the sampl are. You would need to know what you ar mix the vinegar with such as if the cup is empti or if there is water or someth in there. And you would need to know when you start the experiment.
1948	1	In group' acid rain procedure, the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi ar the mass thei start of in how long after to remov the sampl from the contain and the time to allow the sampl to sit and dry.
1949	1	Instead of vinegar thei should put a differ kind of liquid to test with. Also instead of leav it for 24 hour leav it for 48 to see if there would be a certain chang in mass. Also when sampl ar readi to sit and dry leav them there for 45 instead of 30 minutes.
1950	1	The addit inform need is the amount of vinegar, temperatur of the vinegar.
1951	1	I would sai wood becaus the mass differ is 0.On the start mass is 11.2, so is the end of the mass 11.2
1952	1	Thi group gave some of the inform but not all becaus thei didn't sai how much vinig thei put in the container. And the onli did 2 trail,3 trail is what it need to be and the calcul cannot be accura becaus how thei go to leave, it in over min and then come back the next dai and give oe sai ha the got their calcul for ar not enough into.
1953	1	1st you would need to know what is thei were try to figur not ^p ,2nd you need to know what materi thei ar go to us ,3rd i would need to know what there conclus is
1954	1	In order to replic it would mean that you would be more detail and tell if the object is a solid, liquid, or ga it state of form and if it can move or it unmov and describ the item or what type of item it is
1955	1	1.You would need to measur the start mass. ^p 2.You would need to measur the end mass. ^p 3.You would need to measur the differ between the start and end mass.
1956	1	The addit inform you would need to replic thi experi is you would need to know the name of the sampl that you put in the container. You would also have to label the sampl when you remov them from there containers.
1957	1	The addit inform I would need is how much vinegar I would have to put into each sample. Also in order to replic thi experi I would need to know how much of a sampl I need in order to accuratei results. The group also need a problem question becous anoth scientist might want to know why someon want to do thi experi and what the other scientist wa try to determin or prove. Also I would need to know how mani trial I would need to do.
1958	1	One thing you could chang is the amount of vinegar, the sampl size, and were you dry it becaus of the temp.
1959	1	To replic the experiment, You would need to know how much of each sampl wa used, how warm the vinegar is, and how much vinegar to put .
1960	1	Addition inform I would need in order to replic the experi is, the amount of vinegar needed, the size of the cup and also a control to see just how effect thi experi is.
1961	1	To replic the experi in the procedur thei need to be more suspif as to sai what the four differ sampl are. Thei should also be more suspif on how thei measur the mass. The third thing thei should do is told which materi thei were us and then said reapet step 3-6 so that it is clearer and easier to understand.
1962	1	One piec of inform would be how much vinegar to pour into the four containers. Another piec of inform would be how much of the sampl materi to place into the contain so all four contain don't have an advantag or disadvantag becaus of unequ amounts. A last piec of info. would be what temperatur to keep the contain in.
1963	1	You would need to know what sampl you ar using, how to determin the mass of them and what contain you must use.
1964	1	I would need to know
1965	1	An addit piec of inform you would need to replic the experi is the temperatur of the enviro the sampl ar in becaus thei alreadi have the start mass, end mass and the time period.
1966	1	In order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar the group of student how pour into the containers. Secondly, what kind of contain did the student use. Thirdly, what expect is in the sampl itself.
1967	1	In order for me to replic thi experiment, I would need to know what to weigh the object that I am test with. I also need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain and also the unit of measur that I am measur the vinegar with.
1968	1	After read the group procedure, I think I need to know: ^p (1) How much vinegar did thei pour into each containers. ^p (2) Is everi contain get same amount of vinegar. ^p (3) Is everi sampl sit and dry in same environment.
1969	1	In order to replic thi experi you would need to know what amount of each sampl to use, where to to dry the samples, and how big the contain should be.
1970	1	Some addit inform would be, what sampl ar go into the cups, also how much of each sampl ar in a cup and why ar thei do thi experiment.
1971	1	Thi is not a clear statement of the experiments. Aclear statement of the problem would includ an explat of why student were pavestig and the fain.
1972	1	The mass is end 9.4 and of the wood is 11.2 in who the two ar differ at the mass and at wood becaus have differ peso.
1973	1	In thi procedure, there ar a esupl piec of inform that should be included. Thei should tell you how much vinegar you us and if it is the same amount for each sample. Also . it should tell you to record the data of start mass, thei could tell you how long to rins the sampl and the name of the sampl could be includ in the procedure. Finally, at the end of the procedure, it should tell you to record your data and find the differ in the masses.
1974	1	Addition inform you would need to replic thi experi would be to add more materi to the experiment. Adding differ kind of pack could influenc other materi in the experiment. Another peic of inform to be consid would be to increas the time the materi ar soak in the vinegar. Thi would probabl have an increas affect on the materials. Another peic of inform would be to do more trials. Thi would help with pinpoint the exact affect vinegar ha on these materials.
1975	1	The addit inform that I would need in order to replic the experi ar a balanc scale, how much space in contain and how much mass used.
1976	1	I would add water becaus it would be less lighter than the rest of the stuff.
1977	1	In order to replic thi experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar wa pour into each container, how to determin the mass of the sampl and what type of vinegar is be used. I would also need to know how to name and rins each sampl and how to dispos of the vinegar waste. Lastly, for is import to know the textur and distribut of each sampl a container. For example, if the limeston wa crush and pour in the vinegar contain it would dissolv much faster.
1978	1	In order to replic thi experi u would have to try & us mani differ samples. Another wai thei can do thi is to be more pacif on the data, by tell us how mani cup of vinergen is needed.
1979	1	Addition inform we would need is the type of sampl in order to replic the experiment, know how much vinegar to add in four seper ident contain would also need to know how to measur the sampl masses. All thi help to replic the experiment.
1980	1	To replic a better experiment, the first thing you would want to add is how much vinegar is pour in each container. If on contain ha more than the other, more will erod the materi quicker give inaccur results. Another factor thei mai want to chang to the same weight and size of the materi onc again isn't go to give you good results. Lastly, thei shouldn't us the alreadi us materi to replic the experiment. Some materi ar weaker than other and mai erod quicker, so those ar all factor the group of student should add.
1981	1	The first piec of inform that is nesessari to repeat thi experiment, if onli given the procedure, is what the four sampl are. We would also need to know how much vinegar to place in each container. We would also need to know if the contain need to be open or close dure the twenty-four hour period.
1982	1	In order to replic thi experiment, I would need to know opromatli the size of the sampl us so that i would achiev similar results. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar pour into each of the four containers, I need to know thi becaus differ amount of vinegar mai caus more or less of a chang in mass. Another thing that i would need to know is the environ that the sampl ar to sit in, the temperatur and light could effect my results. Lastly, I would need to know if the contain ar cover or left open, if thei ar left open some of the vinegar could evaporte, thu effect my results.
1983	1	"Thei would need to explain how their experi went. So thei us differ object and put them in contain with vinegar to soc. Determin the mass of each. So thi is how thei should explain their experiment. ""We'v test four object in vinegar and the four object were a marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The mass of each were marbl 4.8, limeston 10.4, wood 11.6 and plastic 7.2. When we put them in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minut we saw that the mass of the marbl went down to 9.4, limeston 9.1, wood 11.2, and plastic 7.1. So the mass of the marbl went down -0.4, limeston -1.3, wood 0.0, and plastic -0.1."
1984	1	What addit inform we will need is how much vinegar thei used, what kind of vinegar thei used, and how big and what kind of contain thei used, thei should also have a control group plus, thei should tell for how big each sampl is.
1985	1	In order to replic thi experiment, the addit inform that is need is to record exactli how much vinegar need to be pour into each container. Another piec of addit inform that is need is how to determin the initi mass of each sample. It is also necessari to be specif and state exactli which materi (marble, limestone, wood, or plastic) should be place into each container.
1986	1	In order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container, you would need to know what the four differ sampl were, and you would need to know whether or not to cover or put a lid on the containers.
1987	1	You need a grab for the chart.
1988	1	The procedur did not sai what type of cock shuld be us in thi experiment. The procdur also doe not state hou much vinegar buc in the cups. At the end of the procedur it should sai repeat experi for better results.
1989	1	Thei should have done more trial for each sampl to make sure it is accurat. Also there should be the same amount of vinegar for each sample. It should sai put each sampl in the same size contan and cover the sampl with vinegar or sai how much vinegar to use.
1990	1	Firstly, the student need to be clearer with their procedure.Th amount of vinegar to pour on the sampl can dramat alter the results, so an exact amount is desireable.how big ar the containers, the size matter when replicating.Anoth necess in replic of thi experi is the time us to rins the samples, thei all must be the same
1991	1	How much of a sampl to put in the container. Also, how much big were the containers? And how much vinegar should be used?
1992	1	Should try differ sampl for each container. ^p Another suggest let it sit and dry for differ time. ^p Another, make sure is the same temperature.
1993	1	I think that the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi would be in the procedur tell what we were get the mass of, Also thei should have onc more trial each , why thi observ wa be done.
1994	1	In order to replic the experi I would first need to know the amount of vinegar I need to pour into the containers, It would also be good to sai what thei ar us to determin the mass of the I object whether it wa a tripl beam balanc or an cetric balanc final in order to replic the experi thei would need to tell me what the samor ar becaus it all know is four differ sampl I'm not go to know thei mean marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1995	1	In order to replic the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to use, what form each sampl is in, and the type of vinegar that wa us for the experiment.
1996	1	The addit inform need to replic the experi would first be how much vinegar to pour into the cup and the unit in which to measur the rock mass and vinegar.Thei would also have to includ the purpos of the experi so other understand the experi better.
1997	1	In order to replic the experi more inform could be needed. The procedur would that base to
1998	1	To be abl to replic the folow experi I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.I would also need to know what sampl to use. Where do I put the contain for 24 hours.
1999	1	The addit inform need is the amount of vinegar that goe in each cup, also the need to list the materi and thei need to add the mass object w.
2000	1	You would need to have a control to determin what you ar do the experi for. The student would also need to have a depend variabl as well as a depend variable. The student also need to state what thei ar test in the experiment.
2001	1	In order to replic the experiment, I would need to know what the four differ sampl were becaus thei did not mention them in the procedure. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container, I would need to know how big the contain were.
2002	1	The three differ peic of inform you would need is what sampl ar you us for the experiment. The second thing you would need to measur the mass on a scale befor measur it after the 24 hours. And the third reason is subtract the start mass from the end mass to get the differ between them.
2003	1	Some inform I would need to replic the experi is how much vinegar wa used, what to measur the mass of he sampl with, and how long should the samb be rins with distil water.
2004	1	After read the student procedure, on thing I would add is the amount of vinegar to add to each sample. Another thing I would add in the procedur is the size of the contain thei want the sampl in, and if thei should be covered. The last thing I'd have the student add to their procedur is the actual sampl themselv so that the person can know what substanc thei ar testing. If all those thing were done, the experi would go a lot smoother, and the result would be a lot more accurate.
2005	1	The inform need to replic thi experi is to identifi the differ sampl and how to make them. Thei would need to specifi how much vinegar to pour into the containers, also be more clear about the control in the experiment.
2006	1	The addit inform you could add ar how much of the vinegar do we add to the contain or what kind of vinegar to add becaus thei don't sai thi in the procedure. Also when to start ,thei don't tell you when to start or to end thei onli said after 24 hour remov the samples. Thei also don't tell you how or when to record the mass of the object thei just sai rins contain and let them dry.Also thei need to run two more test.
2007	1	You would need to know the ag of the sampl becaus if the wood is old and dri out it'll absorb some of the vinegar.
2008	1	Addition inform the student should includ ar 1.) What is the problem thei ar try to solve, 2.) List of materials, 3.)Amount of viniger.
2009	1	On order to replic the experiment,
2010	1	After read the group' procedure, the addit inform that I would need in order to replic the experi includ how much of each sampl to us becaus without have the same amount of sample, you don't know wether the mass differ is due to composit or amount, the same appli to the vinegar, without know how much vinegar to pour into the cups, on might be affect more becaus it ha more vinegar in it than the others. Thi can also appli to the distil water, without know how long to rins or how much water to use, on sampl might be affect more.
2011	1	In order to replic thi experi you would need to know if there were ani other factor while you left it sit such as temperature. Sunlight also you need to know the independ and depend variable.
2012	1	To complet thi experi again, the care of the sampl should have been state at the begin with at know know what the sampl are, how ar you suppost to experi on them. There should be a list of all the thing that you will need dure thi experiment. And there should be more detail like, what kind of measur ar you measur the mass, or what kind of contain is it, or were do you store the experi for those 24 hours.
2013	1	a) Size of the containers, type of containers. ^p b) Amount of vinegar. ^p c) Size of the samples.
2014	1	In order to replic thi experi correctly, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the separ containers.Y would also need to know what unit of measur ha to be us to measur the sample. Finally,y would need to know what kind of contain were us and if thei would effect the mass or the samples.
2015	1	In thi lab the inform you would need in order to replic the experi again you should have a control. Another think is that how mani sampl to put in on container. Also, you would need distil water.
2016	1	The three imost thei had bett.wher how much vinegar did thei us for the experiment. Also, that thei forgot to saw how big contain were and if thei cover the contain after thei put the vinegar and materials.
2017	1	In addition, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into the four containers, also the size of the contain and how much of the sampl wa put into each container.
2018	1	Some addit inform I would need to replic thi experi would be certain amount of vinegarI would need to put into each cup, exactli what materi I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remov the sampl from the containers.
2019	1	The addit inform you need would be the materi need for the experiment, the problem that you ar experimenting, depend variable, independ variable, and even a graph to explain their result better.
2020	1	Thei need the data to add of each experiment, need hypothesys.
2021	1	In order to replic the experiment, I would need to know what ar the differ sampl that I am investigating? I would also need to know how to determin the mass of the samples. The group need to clarifi that the sampl ar marble, limestone, wood and plastic. And you measur the mass us a scale and in grams. Lastly, I need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain to replic thi experiment.
2022	1	In orderd to replic thi experiment, the addit inform requir includes;th amount of vinegar pour into containers,th locat where the contain were start and the instrument us to prepar the mass of samples,eith a lapl tempreretur digit scales.
2023	1	In order to replic the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, also how much water you place into each sampl and you would need to record step 3 more clearly.
2024	1	To replic the experiment, I would first off need to know how to determin the mass of the four differ samples. For the next step, would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the piec of material. I would want to know how exactli to rins the seper slab at the end and then know how to measur the mass of the seper sampl at the end as well.
2025	1	Thi procedur is not descript at all. Wedon't even know what to us for the first step. It also doesn't sai the exact amount of what everyth should be. The last mistak it state to label but we ar not sure of the exact name. So all of these mistak would need to be fixed.
2026	1	To replic the experiment, I would need to know what sampl I am sopost to use, how much vinegar I'm sopost to put in these sampl and what I'm supost to look them.
2027	1	You will need to write a hypothesi on the experi and a conclus on what happen and a graph on the chang that the experi went through.
2028	1	To replic thi experi I would have to know what kind of contain thei us and the size of it, also I would have to know where I should remov the sampl to after 24 hours.
2029	1	Thei should have wrote in the 4 differ sampl tell us what thei are. Also thei told us to determin the mass but thei didn't tell us to fing the differ in mass from the start mass to the end mass.
2030	1	To replic the experi again. I would need to know how much vinegar used, I would need to have a control group like marbles, limestone, wood and plastic place in a distil water esp for 24 hour to test my result again. And lastly, I would need all the materi to weigh the same befor start the experiment.
2031	1	You would need to know how much vinegar thei us and what shape the sampl were in. i If thei were all marbl shape the result would veri from a jage figure.
2032	1	I would need them to explain to me how thei got the conclus (mass of the 4 samples). ^p Then I would tell them to includ procedur step by step throught the exsperiment. ^p How much acid rain wa need to effect the mass.
2033	1	To replic thi experi you will need to know the name of the material.How much vinegar to actual pour in the containers. What is the name of the sampl material.
2034	1	To replic the experiment, the group would need to state the amount of vinegar that is to be pour into the containers. The group also need to state if the contain should be cover and at what temperatur the contain should be stored.
2035	1	In order to replic thi experi you would need to know what is the statement that thei ar try prove. Also how much vinegar wa ad to each container. Final each start mass should be the same.
2036	1	It would be veri help if you knew what the mass wa at the end of the expiriment. It also should show exactli how much vinegar you should pour into each container. In that case you can have an exact amount each time. Also it would help to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic we have in each container.
2037	1	Some addit inform you would need to replic thi experi would be what you would us to find the mass, how much vineg to pour in the containers; and where should the sampl lit for 30 minutes? in the heat? in the reid?
2038	1	"To replic the experi more inform is need such as, the amount of vinegar in each cup, what the sampl are, how long the sampl should be rins and clearer direct instead of saying, "" pour vinegar in each of four separ but ident containers,"" explain how much vinegar and whether cup should be larg or small. The experi procedur need to be more specif so that more trial can be done exactli the same or as close as possible, for a more accur conclusion."
2039	1	Some addit inform that thei would need to replic the experi is to add the start mass with the end mass. Then thei get an answer and then thei divid that answer with the answer in the distanc in mass numbers.
2040	1	The next time thi group did thi experiment, thei would get more accur result by measur and record the amount of vinegar pour into each container. Thei should also record the temperatur of at which the contain ar stored. Thi inform will improv the accuraci of the results, and will make it easier to repeat the experiment.
2041	1	To replic the group' procedure,th student will need to tell how much vinegar goe into the ident contaicee. Also thei would need to tell how much distil water would need to be added.
2042	1	In thi groups, procedur you wuld need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in contain and also what kind of container. Also thei could add what tempratur thei left the materi in the containers.
2043	1	After read the group procedure, in order to replic the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar wa needed, how big wa the sampl piec and did need to be close to sunlight or just room light.
2044	1	To replic thi experi well you would need to know more information. The procedur did not tell you how much vinegar to put in each container. The procedur also didn't explain that you should weigh the sampl in gram befor you begin. An experi that is replic mai not alwai be exact, but the import inform should be included.
2045	1	In order to replic the experiment, addit inform need would be the volum of vinegar. Also, the procedur should sai if the contain ar cover or uncovered. Finally, it should specifi what the sampl should dry in, like a petri dish, to avoid contamination.
2046	1	One thing that' need to be done to the procedur is get safeti goggl becaus it' alwai import to be safe. Another thing that' need to be put is gather materi you need. Also the last thing to be done is when your finish with an experiment, clean up your area.
2047	1	Some addit inform I would like to add to thi Acid Rain experi is to tell what amount or how much vinegar to place in the containers. Another suggest is to add more detail to the first step by agknowledg what sampl we have to determin the mass or. Thei might also want to includ what or how to determin the mass of each of the samples.
2048	1	Addition inform need in order to replic the experi would be to know what the four differ sampl ar that ar be tested. Another piec of addit inform need is the amount of vinegar be pour in step 2. One other piec of addit info would be how long to rins the sampl in distil water,and what temperatur the water should be at while rinsing.
2049	1	A proced that I would put in that after thei all dryed, then I out them on a balanc beam scale and then add 4 differ mass from start mass.
2050	1	Addition info need to replic the experi ar sai what sampl type your using, I tell you how to set up the cups, and describ about the samples.If the group did these thing I would be abl to copi thi experiment.
2051	1	Thi is a good procedur to follow, onli it lack of some problem toward the end, which caus the experi to completli go wrong, becaus of the fact that you will be unabl to finish the investigation. I myself would not chang but rather much could a step or two by the procedure, for exampl it is necessari to comprar all the answer with on anoth by subtract and see each other differences, and 8. Depend expara al least three time to see if it is valid.
2052	1	In order to replic thi experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four seper but ident containers. I would also need to know what the four sampl were even though it is state in the data table, it is not state in the procedur where it should be stated. Another thing would be help to know is what type of contain I should I put the sampl in so that I can replic the experi the same wai thei perform it.
2053	1	After read the group' procedur the addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi is specify, type of materi like what kind of wood or plastic did thei us becaus there ar differ kinds. I would also need to know how much vinegar to us for each materi becaus that inform wa not given and us differ amount of vinegar can affect the results.
2054	1	Addition inform you would need would be your independ variable, depend variable, control and you would have to form a hypothesis. The independ dont variabl is what you control and the depend variabl depend on the I.V.
2055	1	In order to replic the experiment, you would need to know what materi were be used. In the procedure, the group wasn't clear on what substanc thei were using. Also, the group need to tell you to find the differ between the 2 mases. Thei were not clear on that in the procedur
2056	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in, what sampl you would us and what the independ variabl could be.
2057	1	First thei would need to list the four sampl name so I know what I am work with. Second, list down the mass of each sample. Finally, list down either you put sampl under heat, cold, where ?
2058	1	First ar thei didn't fell you to put on your safeti gageles. Then thei determin the mass of four differ sampl ar of what to us to get the mass with the next step it doesn't sai what kind of contain to use. Glass or metal or raind or savare, i also don't know what to label. Do you put it on a paper tawel to dry also becaus it doesn't sai how to.
2059	1	In order to replic thi experiment, you will need to know how mani piec of each sampl ar go to be added. You would also need to know the condit of the rest place becaus thei can affect the experiment. In addition, It would also be us to know how the amount ar be measured.
2060	1	In order to replic the experi addit inform I would need would be the amount of vinegar pour into each container. To make sure there is onli on independ variable, the material, the amount of vinegar in each cup must be the same. Also, the temperatur of the room should be identified, becaus it have a possibl effect on the outcome. Last, the volum of each materi need to be specifi should be identical.
2061	1	In order to complet thi experiment, thei need to inquir measur of how much vinegar to put in the cup and how much of each sampl should go into the cup. Also, thei forget to tell you to get a start mass, so you ar capabl of find the differ between the start and end mass.
2062	1	In the group procedure, thei need to add addit information. Thei need to add 1) gather materi then thei should list the materi needed.2) List the 4 differ samples, also thei should add.5)record data, thei should add these three thing becaus you should write a procedur veri detail becaus some peopl might not understand.
2063	1	I would need to know what kind of sampl will I need. I would also need to know how much vinegar should be pour into the containers. Most importantly, I'm go to need to know what to us to figur out the mass.
2064	1	You would need the name of everyth and the number that go with it so that everyon understand what your try to explain to them.
2065	1	To make the experi abl to be replicated, there can be a differ amount of time. There can also be more contain which lastli there can be differ placements, such as on contain can be in the sun, anoth can be in the shade. Or simpli there can be a temperatur differ instead of measur the mass. All these factor can make thi experi reprodurable.
2066	1	Addition inform I will need in order to replcat thi experi is how long you leav the vinegar in the four differ samples, how mani time you have to do it for and how you measur the mass.
2067	1	We need more, start mass, end mass & differ in mass & then test it all over.
2068	1	It is a good statemen ot the problem caus is show u everi thing thei did and everi color, temperatur after s minut and everi temp after 16 minutes.
2069	1	I think in order to replic the experi you would have to chang the data record for thi experiment.
2070	1	In order to replic the experi we would need to know what the sampl ar of. We would also need to know why we ar mass these samples; what ar we try to find. Thirdly, we need to know where to put the containers, the environ must affect the experi in on wai or the another.
2071	1	I don't know.
2072	1	In order to replic the experiment, I would need to know what materi to use. Also how much of each material? For exampl step 2 indic to pour vinegar in container. How much vinegar should I pour? Another thing I would need to know, how to determin thing and it what unit I should. For exampl step 1 indic to determin the mass of four differ samples. It also never specifi type of samples.
2073	1	You need to know what the sampl are. ^p You need to put the start mass of the sampl and record the end mass.
2074	1	Thei would need to includ how much vinegar thei ar pour into each containers, name the sampl that thei ar go to us min their procedur and thei should also sai if thei have ani constants. Those ar some wai in which their procedur would be well.
2075	1	Addition inform needed, would first be what the four differ sampl are. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each containers. In the procedur it sai to place sampl in a contain sinc thei haven't said what sampl there ar peopl wouldn't be abl to replic thi experiment, there' not enough information, and that wouldn't give the most accur results.
2076	1	To begin with the procedur should state how much vinegar should be us in the cup also, it should specifi meriss or materi in thi cup
2077	1	What is the reason for do thi experiment?, what kind of contain should we use?, What should we us to determin mass befor and after.
2078	1	In order to replic thi experiment, it is necessari to know exactli how much vinegar wa put into each container. Also, what type of contain were used. Also, what would need to be known is how much water wa us to rins it off.
2079	1	In order to replic the experiment, some addit inform I would need would be what the 4 differ sampl were. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in the cups. Lastly, I would know how much of the sampl I would be weigh whether it be 50z, or 51b the sampl is not clear in the procedure.
2080	1	To repeat thi experiment, you would need have valid data, a control and more trials. Also I would put the four sampl of vinegar in differ environ such as a refrigar or incubator. To see if the data would be affected.
2081	1	The student could includ what the four sampl actual were. The student should also label the ident contain so thei don't get mix up. The student should also includ what devic they'r find the mass of the sampl with. The student should also includ how much vinegar should be pour into each container.
2082	1	You will need the same amount of the experi becaus it is the main part of the experi and also measur haw much sample/ or vinegar you us and water/check it out often time to see if anyth will happen.
2083	1	In order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar thei used, what temperatur the room in which the sampl were and how much distil water wa us to rins each sampl . Another factor you should know to replic the experi wa if the corner us wa dark or if sunlight touch the rock dure the experiment.
2084	1	The addit inform I would need in order to replic the experi is 1) how much would all the sampl weigh? ^p 2) How much vinegar do I pour in the containers? And 3) Where would thi experi take place. What kind of surround and environment?
2085	1	In the experi limeston ha the most differ in the mass. Wood didn't chang at all. The mass stai the same. Wood had highest start and end mass. To make thi experi better thei could of had more trial.
2086	1	You would need to includ how much vinegar you need to put in the containers. Thei also need to includ the formula for determin the mass. Also thei need to includ how much materi we need.
2087	1	To replic thi experi you would have to no the amount and mass of the vinegar. You would also have to no the temperatur of the vinegar and the temperatur when the stone were drying. Another piec of inform need is the ph of the vinegar. You would also have to no what type of wood us in order to replic the experiment. You would also have to no the type of plastic.
2088	1	To replic thi experi you would requir a few more piec of information. For example, how much vinegar to put in. That piec of inform is never mention in the procedure, and it is veri import to ensur validity. Another piec of inform need is a suppli list. It is never state with what you ar suppos to determin the mass and the onli suppli mention ar the 4 ''containers'' and an unidentifi amount of vinegar. Also, where the contain should be kept is never mentioned, becaus if thei ar store incorrectli it might caus the experi to be invalid.
2089	1	Addition inform need in order to replic thi experi is, we would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container.
2090	1	The student could have said how much vinegar thei put into the containers. Thei also could have said how big or small the contain were.
2091	1	Some addit info that I would need for thi experi is the temp that thei would have the contain in. Also anoth piec of info I would need is how much vinegar I should put in. And last info that I would need is should the room I leav them in be light, dark or should it be moderate. All thi to make the experi reenact accurate.
2092	1	The group of student should have mention in their procedur what four sampl to us in the experiment. Otherwise, the experi wouldn't be abl to be replic becaus we don't know which sampl to use. Also, thei should'v mention the amount of vinegar that should'v been pour in each of the four contain so we know how much to pour in. Thei should also have mention whether or not we had to record the differ in the mass of the sampl or not.
2093	1	To replic thi experi you would need to have a start mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic to do thi you would also need to us the group' procedure.
2094	1	To replic the experiment, you would need to know what the four differ sampl are, you also need to know the start mass for each sample, how to determin the mass of each sampl and where to keep the contain for the 24 hours.
2095	1	In step number 5, you should specifi where to let the sampl is and dry. Make sure it is not too cold or too hot. In step 2, you should includ how much vinegar to pour into each container. In step 1 and 6, you should describ how to find the mass of the samples.
2096	1	In order to replic the experi there need to be how much vinegar to use.
2097	1	In the group procedur I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container,how to determin the mass and what to label each contain in order to replic the experiment.
2098	1	When the tell you to determin the mass of four differ sampl thei should sai start mass. In step two thei should sai how much vinegar to pour into all containers. The should includ determin the end mass.
2099	1	You would need to know what kind of sampl to use, how much vinegar is used, and how to dry them.
2100	1	After read the group procedur in order to replic is on must add three thing such as amount of vinegar pour into the containers, need a scale and a type of vinegar.
2101	1	I would neet to know the samples, a discript of them, in order to do the investigation, in order to make it clear and understandable.
2102	1	I would need to get a lsit of all the differ materials. I would also had to know how much vingar to us also on els end result might not be as others. I would also need to folow how much
2103	1	Yow'd need to know how muchvinegar wa pour into each sample. You'd needto know how much of each sampl you'd need, how long should you rins it.
2104	1	The student have neglect to includ the amount of vinegar and it is hard to replic the lab without measurements. The student should also includ other trial and also if the vinegar need to be replaced. These ar import to procur correct results.
2105	1	You would need to find out what the mass is (question 1 ), we would also need to know what the remain sampl ar (question 2). Lastly, we would want to answer question 6 and find out the mass.
2106	1	To repeat thi groop procedure, you would need 3 addit piec of information. ^p 1. The amount of vinegar to put on the sample. ^p 2. The amount of each sampl that you need. ^p 3. The amount of distil water to rins each sample.
2107	1	Read the group' procedur it should have been more thorough for me to replic that experiment. Thei need to includ in their procedure, the 4 type of sampl that were experi on.Th amount of vinegar us in their experiment, the type of contain that were us and the size of each container. Thei also need to includ the name of the sampl that should be pour into contain and also which container. Also where were the contain left to dry the temperatur of the atmospher outsid or inside, for me to be abl to replic thi experiment.
2108	1	You would need to know how much vinegar you ar pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is how much of a sampl you put into the labl container. Finally, at the end you should us the same amount of distil water to rins off the vinegar at the end.
2109	1	In order to replic the experiment, the group would need to specifi in number on the four differ samples. In step 3, thei need to specifi which sampl goe into which container,and lastly, thei should add anoth step which should state that thei should run atleast 3 trial so that their inform could be accurate.
2110	1	The addit inform that I need in order to replic the experi is 1:I have to get all the ingredi for the experi .2: Later I have to put all the ingredi to ge ther and I have to show how to prepar the experiments.Then iI all the ingredi and I have to know how to prepar the experi and later I have to give the time necesari and for the end I have to check wa what the result.
2111	1	First you have to determin the sampl name. Predict the mass so when the right answer come up you dont get shocked. At the end of the procedur compar them to your prediction.
2112	1	In order to replic the experi thei would need to determin the mass of the four differ sampl 2 time of four vinegar in each of four seper but ident contain 2 times. Next,plac a sampl of on materi into on contain 2 times. Then repeat with the remain sampl and place a singl sampl into a singl container. After 24 hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water. Allow the sampl to sit and dry for 30 min then determin the mass of each sample.
2113	1	In order to replic thi experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the four containers. The amount of vinegar would affect the differ of mass and time. Also, I would need to know what kind of contain it us for place the sampl in. Some contain might not allow enough room for the samples. Lastli I would need to know how much distil water I would need to rins the substanc with.Thi could chang the differ in mass.
2114	1	To improv the group experi thei would need to add to the procedur how thei found the differ in masses. Also the group should includ clearli when the start record and when thei stope recording. Finally, to improv these student lab I think the should expain the list of materi thei were us and it size.
2115	1	One thing we would need to know in the procedur is how much vinegar to pour in the containers. If we don't know how much vinegar to put in the result would end up differently. Another thing we would need to know is what size of contain to put the vinegar in, we would also need to know what object to put in what amount of vinegar.
2116	1	In order to replic thi experi I would need to know how much vinegar wa present in the contain and the size of the rock sampl to assur that the rock came in contact with the same amount of vinegar on it' surfac in both experiments. I would also want to know thei type of vinegar so I could us the same kind.
2117	1	In order to replic the lab that the student made, the procedur for you would have to know, what kind of materi you ar us for the practic to place in the vinegar. Also, you would need to measur what after place below, you should go through befor includ the labs. You also need to know how big the contain should be and how much vinegar to use.
2118	1	In order to replic thi experiment, thei should also put so the procedure, how much vinegar so the amount of liquid is equal, where thei should sit & dry (a window, canter, if it on anything, under a light etc.) How do you rins it with distil water( also you us soap, let it sank to get vinegar out or do you dump water on it then let it dry).
2119	1	The exact amount vinegar pour in each container. How to measur the amount of mass each has.
2120	1	The amount of vinegar, the temperatur of the room, and the marbl should be the same size.
2121	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the differ samples. You would need to know also what on marene, you put into the contain and label, and you would need to know exactli what materi you put with each samples.
2122	1	The group procedur is, although somewhat thorough hard to replicate. In order foreach sampl to get the same treatment and be as accur as possibl you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you also would need to know how much water to rins with. The right factor is also important. The student should be more specif about where the sampl should be put, rather light or dark, becaus thi effect the outcome.
2123	1	Some addit inform need to repeat thi process would be how much vinegar to put in each container, if we should let the sampl sit in room temperatur or in hot and colder area, new to determin the mass, and how much of each sampl should we place into the singl container.
2124	1	Thei didn't come up with conclusions, thei problem, thesi
2125	1	The addit inform from the procedur is what the sampl are. It tell you in the tabl but you wouldn't be given that along with the procedure. Secondli you need to know what contain you should be using. Lastli you will need to know what the materi ar and also how to determin the mass of each sample.
2126	1	In the group procedur instead of just sai a contain sai what kind and it' size. The procedur need to includ what you see to weigh the samples. The procedur need to be more specif with the samples. I would need to know if I had to treat each sampl differently.
2127	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to put into the differ samples. I would also need to know in what kind of contain becaus the materi can effect the outcom and whether to leav the contain in room temperatur or in the heat.
2128	1	After read the group procedur the inform that I would add would be to determin how much materi I would add to on cup. I would also need to know how much distil water is need in the cup. After do that I would also need know how much vinegar is allow in the cup.
2129	1	To replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar I need to put into the containers. I would need to know how to measur the mass in.
2130	1	You would need to know that you have to mass it befor you do anyth and you have to mass it after the whole expirement. You need to know how much vinegar to pour on the samples.
2131	1	The group should specifi what ar the four differ samples. More inform is need on what should be done to the sampl dure the 24 hours. Also we need to know what kind of instrurr is us to measur the sample.
2132	1	One thing that you would need to know is how much vinegar your using. Another thing would be how your go to weigh these materials, lastli you would need to know exactli what your look for in these materials, such as if thei dissolv or grew.
2133	1	In order to demonstr thi experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar should be pour into each cup. You also would need to know how to determin the mass which would go in the first step of the procedure. The sampl also should be rins with the same amount of water, which should also be in the procedure.
2134	1	The addit inform that need to be ad to the procedur is what ar thei measur everyth in. Also, we would need to know what size contain thei us small, medium, or large. Plu where ar thei remov the sampl from. We would need to know that befor we even start the lab. Last, how ar we go to find the mass by a tripl beam balance. The procedur need more inform or we can't even start the lab.
2135	1	Addition inform you would need would be why thei ar do thi experi (purpos statement), more trial of the experi and a control.
2136	1	First you would have to sai what the sampl have to be , you also have to sai how much vinegar to pour in the containers, and how big the contain should be.
2137	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. Where ar we go to put the contain so thei get the same amount of heat/sunlight. How long should you rins it for.
2138	1	I would need all four samples: Ad the old results, and vingar. Also water and containers.
2139	1	You would need to know how much of the sampl wa used. Also, you would need to know how much vinegar wa us and lastly, you would need to know how big the cond is us and put the sampl into.
2140	1	The addit inform I would need to replicate, thi experi is the mass of the cup used. If I were to measur the materi in a cup. The cup also ha a mass so you will have to substanc that one. Also, you would need to know the actual name of the sampl be used. The procedur doe not includ that inform and that is vital to hav.Th other thing that I would to know is how much vinegar to the top of the contain specifi just a littl bit.
2141	1	Some addit inform I would need to replic thi experiment, is first off how mach vinegar to pour in each contain us to much or to littl vinegar can skew the results. Secondly, I would need to know in what condit I should plac the contain in. It is possibl heat and light mai alter the results. Finally, I would need to know if the contain should be cover or not. The sampl be expos to oxygen can also alter the results.
2142	1	(1)If Put not show wait so labl ^p (2) How long we ^p (3)Expt more about the
2143	1	In order to repeat thi experi on my own, the group of student should have first off, talk about what the four sampl thei were test were. Also thei should have told us the amount vinegar that wa need to be us in each sample. And lastly, thei should have explain in their procedur to calcul the differ in their start mass, and end mass.
2144	1	In order to replic thi experiment, I will need to know more inform such as how much vinigar in each of four seprat contain and how long the experi is, pecif mersur will help also.
2145	1	In step one, I would need to know what the four sampl were that I wa determin mass of. In step two, I would need to how much vinegar to pour into the containers. I would need to know what temperatur to place the sampl at in step 4.
2146	1	You'd need a stop wacth, you'd need to be there at the exact time,leav the mass
2147	1	After read the group' procedure, on piec of addit inform that would need to be includ to replic their experi would be includ the name of the four differ sampl that ar be tested. Another piec of inform should be that, in step 1 and 6, that you make sure to record each separ mass and not just determin them. A final piec of inform should be how much vinegar to pour in.
2148	1	The addit inform need in thi experi is minimum of three. Such as in number in number two, thei should tell you how much vinegar should be ad in the four separ containers. Also when thei sai to put the sampl materi in the contain thei should sai if there is a size limit. Most of all, to find out the mass, you need to show what unit thei measur in so you can get the correct or some data as them.
2149	1	In order to replic thi expier I would need to have all the materi that ar found in thi procedure. I would then gather all of my materi and follow the procedur and also record my data down on a piec of paper. In expier I alwai like to bring a watch for time the sampl just in case there ar none around.
2150	1	After read the group' procedur I would need more specif inform to replic the experiment. First, the procedur sai to pour vinegar in each container, but it doe not specifi how much should be used. Also, the procedur doesn't sai what size contain I would us for each of the contain us in the experiment. Last, the procedur doesn't sai where I should pour the residu after the rinse.
2151	1	After read the group' procedure, I then figur out how thei could replic it. Thei could chang the amount of vinegar thei put in each sample. Also, thei can record the room temperatur to see if it chang within the 24 hours. Finally, thei can chang the type of water that thei us in step 4 to make a difference.
2152	1	In order to replic thi experi I would need the mass of the containers, a descript of the container, and a control in order to maxim the accuraci of the data.
2153	1	To replic the experement, I would need to know the problem of the experiment. What the mass of the sampl ha to do with the experi and what the marble, limestone, wood, and plastic ar for.
2154	1	In order to replic the group procedure, you would need to know the amount of vinegar thei used. Thei would need a control group and the amount of distil water us to rins the materials. Thei also need amount of time in distil water, more trial could be done for accuracy.
2155	1	First, the procedur need is specif which materi ar be us as sample. In the procedure, there wa and mention of the sampl be marbl of ani kind. Also, the procedur doesn't a tempt to control the amount of vinegar in each container. Thi is necessari to replic the experi as differ volum of vineea eas after the estume. The procedure, final need to keep the size of the marbl constant. Surfac area mai be a factor in the experiment.
2156	1	After read the group procedure, some addit inform that should be ad is to list what number step that you have to repeat becaus it a littl confus on what step to repeat. Another on is to list out the materials, it ha no inform on what materi ar be us onli in the data tabl which wa done after the experiment. Next thing thei should add is the amount of vinegar,wat etc that is need for the experi for all trial and lastli thei should be specif about where to put thing for exampl where do you put the materiasl often wash them off.
2157	1	After read the group procedure, 4 thing that would need to be ad ar that thei would need to identifi the four differ samples, thei would need to tell you the amount of vinegar to put in each cup, thei would need a control and lastli thei would need to do multipl trial in order for it to be a valid experiment.
2158	1	To replic thi experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It doesn't tellyou how much vinegar you need. Also, I would need to know the size of the samples. Should thei all be the same size or different? It doesn't tell you what size the sampl should be. The last piec of inform I would need is what the sampl even are. The procedur doesn't tell you which materi to even use.
2159	1	I would need to know what kind of contain the sampl were put in,and the amount of vinegar pour on the samples, also the kind of vinegar.
2160	1	In the group procedur thei do not includ some detail that ar crucial for the experi to be repeated. First you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You would also need to know how much of each sampl wa put into each tube. You would also need to know if the experi wa repeat to see that there wa no error accident ,happen and you would need the name of the sampl that you ar useing.
2161	1	One thing that thei don't sai that you need to replic the experi would be, how much of the sampl to use. The procedur dosn't sai that you need to find the differ in the masses.
2162	1	In order to repeat thi experi I would need to know how much vinegar thei pour into the contain for each sample. I would also need to know what kind of marble, wood and plastic thei us sinc there isn't on kind of each. It would be us to know what contain were us and hou long thei rins the sampl for.
2163	1	In order to replic the experiment, I would need to know what to us to determin the mass of the 4 differ samples, sinc it doe not state that in the procedure. Also, the sampl of the item should be ad in becaus you have no idea what you ar testing, if thei ar not in the procedure. Also, there should be a given amount of vinegar in the procedure, not a vagu description. Not have the same amount of vinegar in all 4 contain could affect the experiment.
2164	1	In order to replic the experiment, i would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. Also i would need to know how long to rins the rock with distil water. Without those piec of information, i could not precesili replic the experiment.
2165	1	Another piec of inform you might need, is how much distil water is used. Also if you ar using. the same amount of each sample. Even maybe, how much vinegar you ar us on each sample.
2166	1	The addit inform you would need to replic the expir wald be an accur mesur of vinegar be pare into the containers. Also an accur measur of the distil water you would us for each contain to rins it off, after 24 hours.
2167	1	For thi group' experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar I need in each cup. I also do not know what the four differ materials/sampl are, so it would be nice to have some ideas. Thei should also put down to try thi two or three time all togeth so we have more than on of the tabl to read.
2168	1	"There ar three piec of addit inform that could be reach to replic the experiment. In step 1 and 6 thei sai that thei determin the mass of the samples. We must know how thei do the or what ri thei use. Also in step 2 thei sai ""pour vinegar"". We must know how much vinegar to put into each container. Lastly, in step 4, thei sai to ""rins each sample"". We must know for how long or what method were us to accomplich this."
2169	1	To replic thi experi you would need a specif amount a vinagar, you would also need to know what the 4 sampl were. you also need to have water in the contain contain the vinagar.
2170	1	What inform I would need would pcobbali be marble, limeston and wood.
2171	1	The addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar you ar suppos to put in each of the four containers. Another inform that you will need is what' the size of each of the four contain becaus when you put the vinegar, it ha to be on equal amount and if you don't know the size of the contain it will affect the experiment.
2172	1	In thi experiment, the procedur did not tell us what the four materi were. Thei never told us how big the contain should be. And after pour vinegar into the contain why would you get anoth contain to put them in? It wa veri confusing.
2173	1	First you would need to gather your materials. Then becaus safeti is first, make sure you ar readi with goggl and gloves. After you organ yourself, you then determin the mass of four differ sampl and so on. After the experi you complet your data with the follow inform and a graph/chart.
2174	1	The student need to explain what sampl thei were us in the procedure, thei need to sai how much vinegar to us and what type of vinigar to use.
2175	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in the cup, how much sampl for each cup and how much distil water to us to rins with. You must know all these measur or the experi could be wrong. The data could be wrong which would the make your lab report & conclus wrong.
2176	1	What kind of contain ar needed? What ar the four differ sampl ? How much vinegar do you put in to each container?
2177	1	I would pour the vinegar in non-ident contain so you could know which is which. You could measur how much you put in to the cup or containers. Thei could have done the trial more than onc to make it wa correct.
2178	1	Marbl limeston and plastic all absent in the neget in differences.
2179	1	In order to replic that experi you need to sai what 4 differ sampl you ar using. You also need to sai how you ar go to label the cups. In measur the 4 differ sampl you need to sai how to mease. You lastli need to mention the materi you need to us for that procedure.
2180	1	To make thi procedur complete, there should be specif about how big the contain are, there should also be specif about how much vinegar you pour in these containers. Lastly, sai how you determin the mass of each sampl hey.
2181	1	In order to replic thi experiment, you would need to add what the four exampl ar in the procedures, that way, the experi know what they'r work with. You would also includ a control, and independent/depend variables, also, take observations.
2182	1	You will need to know exactli what materi ar needed. You must also know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Also the start weight of each.
2183	1	1.What shape the sampl were ^p 2.What type of vinegar wa us ^p 3.What type of marble, limestone, wood and plastic wa us
2184	1	In order to replic thi experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar is be put into each cup. The specif type of plastic, wood, limeston and marbl and how long the sampl were rins for.
2185	1	In order for me to replic thi experiment, I would need to know need to knew how big each contain wa the hold the samples.I would need to know much vinegar to put in each container. Also I would need to know how to measur the mass of the 3 objects.
2186	1	I would need to know the materi that ar go to get measured. The amount of time that each materi stai in the vinegar. The stare mass and the end mass of each material.
2187	1	The inform need would be what is try to be proven with thi investigation. Also, thei would need to state what the origin sampl ar & thick of each origin sample.
2188	1	I will need a balanc to weight the mass of four differ samples.Replac vinegar for lemon and put in each four edentically.Aft 24 hours, i will us water to rins each sample. After i will us the balanc to check if there is ani chang in the mass of each.
2189	1	Addition inform I would need in order to replic thi experi is that I would need to know what measur tool to us in order to weigh the sampl (triple-beam balance). I would also need to determin the differ in the mass of the samples. The group show the differ on their data table, but didn't list that step in their procedure. Lastly, I would need to record everi differ mass on the data tabl which also isn't a step in the group' procedure.
2190	1	In addit to the procedur in acid rain experiment, thei forgot to state their hypothesi but in the begin thei also forgot to state their materi such as marble, limestone, wood & plastic in their procedur or how much vinegar in each solution.
2191	1	What the procedur is ask is for them to find awai how to make acid rain. Yo will need contain to hold the rain, then your will need to label the containers. After 24 hour thei will be readi to then find out the mass.
2192	1	The addit inform I will need in order to replic the experi is the procedures, so I know what Im doing. The samples, so I know what Im work on. Then start mass.
2193	1	One thing someon would need is which materi thei ar testing, if the procedur doesn't includ marble, limeston etc, then it can't be replicated. The procedur should also includ how much vinegar to put into each contain becaus of thi faster mass not control the experi won't be valid. Finally, the student need to add where to keep the contain becaus differ environ can affect the result thei get for each.
2194	1	I would need there 1.predict to what thei were realli questioning. I would probabl sai the date and time also, includ there conclusion.
2195	1	Thei did not look up data about acid bain and thei need t.
2196	1	"In order to replic thi experiment, first of all the ""samples"" would need to be identifi as ""sampl of ..."". Thei should start out at roughli the same mass as well. The amount of vinegar should have been constant for each container. How were the contain labeled, numerically, or by name?"
2197	1	The inform that you would need in order to replic the experi is the sampl and contain sizes. Also you need labl to identifi each sonifi container. The same amount andend of vinegar and water. Finally, the same amount of time. And creat a labl the somewher
2198	1	Some addit inform I would need to complet the experi would be to know what the sampl ar in the procedure, also I would need to know how big the contain need to be and how much vinegar to pour in. Also I would need to know what temperatur the sampl need to be at, also if thei ar cover or uncovered. Then I would need to run a control of water on the sampl and run the experi multipl times.
2199	1	In order for me to replic the experiment, I would need to know how much vinigar to pour in with the stones.Anoth thing i would need to know is what ar the four materials.No where in the procedur is there name of stones.Anoth would be how much of the sampl to us in grams.Nowher in the procedur is there an indic of the mass.
2200	1	Thei will need to includ how much vinegar to put into the containers. Thei also need to make sure that the sampl have the same orrigion mass. I will also need to know what the control is and how mani time re repeat the experi for valitity. Also, how long should we nase the sampl for.
2201	1	To do thi experiment, you need to know how much sampl to put in a cup, the amount of vinegar that need to be pour into the cup with the sampl in it, and how mani trial to do the experiment.
2202	1	For me too replic thi experi the addit inform I would need is were did thei sit the contain did it sit in the room , freezer were.Thei all so could of told us if thei us move trait or not.
2203	1	Thi procedur can be improved. You must keep everyth constant, includ the amount of start mass which wa not done in thi experiment. Multipl trial would prevent mani error from be record becaus there would be materi to keep the number in the appropri range. A control should also be ad such as not pour anyth on on of each sample. The correct will make the lab much more accurate.
2204	1	You will need marble, limestone, wood becaus thei the variabl piec in thi experiment. You will need to experi with all of there.
2205	1	In order to replic the experi you will need to know what size the contain need to be. Also you need to know what ar the contain bowls, plates, cup and you would also need to know to determin the mass of each sample.
2206	1	I would like to have known why were thei do thi experiment? And why didn't or the sampl get compar with warer by the vinegar?
2207	1	Well first a problem statement would be help know there independ and depend variabl also know their control group would have helped.
2208	1	In order to replic thi experiment, i need to know how much vinegar to put into 4 seprat containers. I need to know what materi to use, so without the inform that i list i would not be abl to do thi experi 30 minut it wa done the first time. With the inform that thei left of wa in there then i would be abl to replic thi experiment.
2209	1	I would need to know how much vinegar is to be put in each container. I would also need to know how long I had to rins each item. I also need to know what the sampl were dri on.
2210	1	In order to replic thi experi the procedur would have to sai which sampl to use. It actual onli sai place a sampl of on materi into a container, I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The procedur onli sai pour vinegar in each of four seperate, but ident containers. For thi step I would need to know what size of contain I should us for the experiment. I would also have to measur each sampl befor and after doing, the lab so I would add that to my procedure.
2211	1	Addition inform I com to replic thi experi would be how much vinegar to put in the containers. How mani rock should be place in the container, and how larg the contain should be. Thi addit inform would help me to replic the acid rain experiment.
2212	1	The group would need to tell me what type of contain to use. Am I us a bucket, a beaker or what? Do I put all the materi in separ contain at the same time, or do I wait until the first on is finish to start the second one. What am I remov the sampl with. My hands, tongs, what? Thi is the addit info need to replic thi experiment.
2213	1	I will need to no what ar the name of the four differ sampl I'm determarn the mass. I will also need to no what unit am I measur by but last but not least, I will need to no how big is the contain is.
2214	1	What could be ad to thi group procedur is thei could perform more trial so that thei could get more results. Thei also could find a control so that thei could compar all of their answer to now the control wa affect and thei also could move vinegar the four differ sampl right after thei took them out of the vinegar becaus the water could have had as affect an their accurate.
2215	1	Further inform would include, why or what purpos the student were conduct the expirement, what size the sampl were and explain why each sampl is a differ mass. ^p The purpos wa to record and compar the mass of each sample.
2216	1	In order to replic thi experi you would need is to know how mani contain we would need.
2217	1	To replic the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain becaus it doesn't give a specif amount. We would also need to know how much water we need to rins the sampl off with after the 24 hours. Also, we need to know what we ar determin the mass with, becaus the procedur just sai find the mass.
2218	1	One thing you should need to know would be to know what type of sampl you would need to set. If you don't know what sampl to use, then the experi is useless. Also you should know how much of the vinegar to put into each of the containers. And finally, you should know what to weigh your sampl on and if you should set the weigher to 0 befor weigh it in. You need to know what to weigh it on befor there ar mani differ weigh system for biologi and if you don't know which ar to use, then your lab might cam out wrong.
2219	1	First of all, we would need to to knew what the four differ sampl are. Thi wai we can talk about it in our data and conclusion. Also, we meed to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain becaus that is a control variable. Lastly, it never sai to messur infrom so we do not know how much of the materi we should be measur
2220	1	Addition inform I would need to replic the experiment, would be the amount of vinergar to place with the samples. Also, I need to know if there were certain temperatur the sampl need to be place in. The last thing I need to know is what type of contain to put the sampl in. You don't know if the vinegar is go to affect the containers.
2221	1	In order for me to replic the experiment, I would need to know where the contain were kept for 24 hours. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the four separ containers. Last but not least, I would need to know how much of plastic, wood, limeston and marbl to put into the contain of vinegar to repeat thi experiment.
2222	1	One piec of inform that would be need to replic the experi is how much vinigar wa ad to the containers. Another piec of inform need is, what kind of contain were us in the investigation. Finally, the last poic of inform need to replic the investig is, how long would the sampl be rins with distil water, also how much water wa us to rinse.
2223	1	You place the sampl of on materi contain into on contain and label repeat the sampl iinto a singl container. After 24 hours,remov the dry sampl and rins each sampl with distil water. Allow the sampl to sit and dry for 30 min.
2224	1	You would need to know the size of the containers. What brand of vinigar wa used, so that there can be no chang in data. Last you would need to know what it wa weigh on.
2225	1	In order some to replic I need to know how big each contain was. How much vinegar wa pour on the the subjects. Also I would need each of the subject to have the same mass. Show it would be more correct it it wa all the same size.
2226	1	If I want to make the same kind of experiment, I would pour vinegar in each of the 4 separ but ident containers. Then I would wait 24 hour then rins each sampl with distil water. Finally, allow all the sampl to sit and dry for 30 min.
2227	1	In orderto replic the experi i would need to know the 4 differ sampl us state in the procedure. I would also need to know what and why we ar perform the experiment. In other words, the purpos and problem. I would also need to have state in the procedur to calcul the differ in mass.
2228	1	In order to replic thi experiment, the procedur would need to be rewritten with more detail. First, a step to record the mass of 4 sampl befor place them in vinegar would need to be added. Next, the procedur doe not specifi how much vinegar should be in each container. Another step thei did not add wa to re-label the sampl after thei ar remov from vinegar, in order to tell them a part from each other.
2229	1	After read the group procedur i would conclud that i will add a independ variabl to the lab. Also i would want to place the contain in a constant temperatur area for more accur testing.
4066	2	Base on the student data I can conclud that plastic type B ha the largest amount stretched. Two wai that the student could have improv the experiment decison is by allow the weight to hang longer to see if the plastic would stretch more. Another wai he could have improv hi experi is by do a third trial to realli be sure that hi result ar correct.
4067	2	A. Sampl B plastic ha the most stretchability. B. One wai it to add the origin length of the plastic to the chart so you can find the differ of the origin and after it stretched. Another wai is to show the weight of the weight be put on.
4068	2	The stretchiest plastic wa plastic B in both trials. And the least stretchiest plastic wa plastic A in both trials. ^p The student could have improv the experi by ad a control and us the same length of each plastic.
4069	2	a. Conclusion: type a plastic stretch the most. ^p b. The student have us the same length of plastic for everi type and should have did more than on trial.
4070	2	a) Plastic type A and B stretch after be pull apart for five minutes. Plastic type C and D either shrank in length or stai the same.^p b) The student should of ad a control by hang the plastic with no weight. Also the student should specifi how much weight is on the clamp.
4071	2	A.) Base on the data of the table, I conclud that plastic B wa the most stretchable. In both trial it prove to be alwai abov 20mm. ^P B.) The student could'v us differ clamp in hi trials, thi would'v expand the student possibl with the plastics. To help with the validity, the student could explain what he did different. For trial T2, for the measur ar not the same as T1 except for plastic type D, in both trial the measur were the same.
4072	2	The conclus that I have drawn is that plastic B wa the strongest. Plastic B wa the strongest becaus in trial on it stretch the most to 22mm. Ther trial two B stretch to 23mm. To improv the experi design the student could state a length thei want the sampl plastic to be. In the procedur the student should have state label that she/h wa measur in.
4073	2	A conclus that can be dawn from the student experi is that plastic B is abl to stretch the farthest (T1:22mm, T2:23mm) and plastic A stretch the least (T1:10mm, T2:12mm). The valid of thi experi could have been improv greatli by do these two things; 1) Make sure that the start length of the plastic were all the same and 2)determin how much of the plastic will be stretch to the tabl at the beginning. By do these two things, you'r ensur control variabl therefor valid your experi
4074	2	B. Two wai the student could improv the experi is to do it again and again until you get the same results. Another wai could to leav the plastic hang for longer.
4075	2	I conclud that plastic type B is the most stretchabl becaus accord to the data plastic B in trial 1 stretch 22mm and trial 2 23mm unlik plastic type A which in T1 stretch 0mm and in trial 2 2mm. One wai the student could have improv their experi would be of sai exactli how much weight to add and keep it the same for all the plastics. Another wai thei could have improv thi experi would be by have the same length of plastic for all the plastics, also thei could have done more trial to improv their experiment.
4076	2	a. Base on the data, the strectchiest polym plastic of the four is plastic type B, becaus in the both trials, it stretch the most (22 and 23 mm). ^p b. 1.) Add more trial to increas accuraci of the results. 2.) Repeat the experi with heavier weight to see if it affect the results.
4077	2	a) The onli type of plastic that appear to make no chang with the 2 trial is plastic type D. ^p b) Thei could have improv their design/valid by tell us exactli how much thei measur in procedur 1. Another would be thei could do a 3rd trial.
4078	2	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchabl of all the plastic types. Type D wa a close second. Plastic type A and C ar not veri stretchy. ^p b. To improv the valid of the experi the student could have done 2 things, give the length of the plastic thei us and give the amount/typ of weight to weigh the plastic down with the information, the experi can be duplic to get similar results.
4079	2	Thu for our experiment our data ha prove in conclus that plastic type B and D recivi similiar result as also high strechibl on their first trial. One wai the student could have improv the data is by put the tike in the data chart. Another wai be how student could have improv their data is by tell the amount of weight ad for stretching.
4080	2	a. Plastic Type B stretch the farthest in both trials. Type D stretch second farthest in each trial and C and A stretch the third and least farthest respectively. The order of each plastic type' stretchi remain the same in both trials. ^p b. The student could have done more trials. Thei also could'v us more specif types.
4081	2	In conclus thi is what the plastic did in the first try and thi is what happen in the second try. The best plastic is plastic B becaus it hang longer than the other. ^p To make it better is hang it for 7 minutes. mayb put someth els than weight, I think scissors.
4082	2	a) Plastic D is the best type of plastic becaus it' the most stretchabl unlik type A which is the least stretchable.^p b.) Do anoth trial and add heavier weights.
4083	2	Trial 2 wa the most stretch plastic becaus after stretch them a coupl of time then thei set loos and stretchier than the first time. The most stretchiest wa plastic B it ha the most stretch than the others. ^p The student could'v kept it hang mayb a littl bit longer.
4084	2	3. Base on the data, plastic D held the most weight. Plastic A held the least. Plastic C went down the second time, so mayb it wasnt sturdi enough. Two wai thei could improv their experi is to us differ size plastics. Instead of put it attach to the table, it could be stretch over a cup. By do thi it will hold more weight, and thei will get more acur answers.
4085	2	A) When deal with differ type of plastic to find out their strechability, I found that plastic type A that 1 had the least amount of stretchability, with onli 10mm, wherea plastic type B, trial two out measur A, C, and D' stretchabl with 25mm!^p B) 1. He could'v specifi the name of the plastics, 2. He could'v specifi the weight ad and made sure they'r the same.
4086	2	A.D wa the most and stai the same tril 1 and tril 2.^p (B)He should of done anoth tril to make sure if he got different/ same results.
4087	2	Base on the student data plastic type B stretch the most, plastic type A did the least amount of stretching. ^p Thei could have us more trials. Thei also could have ad on more weight over a period of time.
4088	2	There is onli two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design is by tell the dai or hour of the experiment, and see if the student' hypothesi wa correct or not.
4089	2	The student that could of have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result it make sure all their suppli ar there put the data tabl in order, and follow the time as instructed.
4090	2	(A) Plastic type B wa the superior in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p (B) Record the weight that wa put on to show how much effect each plastic. Also conduct more trial and make a larger graph to show the growth and chang of each plastic.
4091	2	The plastic streatur more or less depend on the type could have reapeat it again to see what would happen us type of plastic.
4092	2	Base on the student data all differ type of plastic wa stretch more than others. Plastic B stretch the farthest, plastic A stretch the lowest. You can conclud that plastic B wa the better plastic for the polym investigation. ^p 1 Way) student could have chang or test the differ plastic at differ times. (wai 2) Remov the weight from 2 plastic and leav the other 2 with to see the outcom difference.
4093	2	a) Plastic type B stretch the furthest make it the weakest type of plastic. However, plastic type A stretch the least, make it the stordest. b) 1.The student should have had atleast on more trial for complet accur results. 2. The student should have more specif by give unit to measur length in and specif type of plastic.
4094	2	A conclus that I can draw from thi data is that plastic type B, stretch the most on both trial (22, 23mm). Two thing that could be improv in thi experi ar that a third or more trial could be performed, and also the amount of weight put on should be monitored, and controlled.
4095	2	a) Polym plastic type B ha the highest stretchability. It had 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. None of the other type of plastic stretch further than 20mm on either trial. ^p b) The student could have test more type of plastic or made more trial to improv the experiment.
4096	2	I conclud that plastic A and B strech the most. One wai the student could have improv the design is by state how much weight thei were adding. Another wai is if thei record a control for validity.
4097	2	"A. Base on the data plastic D isn't veri stretchi becaus it wa the same length in both trials. It didn't vari by even an inch. Plastic B must be stretchi becaus it stretch the largest in both trials. B. Thei could have includ more trial thei could have at in includ the origin length of the plastic (befor be stretched) so you could compar ""see how much each on stretched."
4098	2	3. a) Plastic type A stretch the most C. b) Thei could of had more trial and us more type of plastic.
4099	2	For the conclus it wasn't a big differ from the (T1) and (T2). It wa more like 1 or 2 amount stretch from the first trial we did the procedur 2 time and have got differ thing most of the time.^p Thei could have had an empti plastic cup hang from the plastic type to see it there wa much difference. The could have also don a third trial just to see if there wa much difference.
4100	2	The group can conclud that plastic type B, is the most effect type of plastic. Accord to the table, Plastic type B held 22mm in trial 1, and 23mm in trial 2. That wa the best close follow by the type D with 20mm, and 20mm. In the experiment, the group could have done 1 more trial to realli reinforc the results. Along with that be said, the group also should have measur the weight of the weights, and kept the weight constant for more valid results.
4101	2	A) Our expira wa successful. Some of the plastic that we stretch out increas dure trial 2. ^p B) Thei could have told us how long or wide the plastic ha to be and how to rap if to the table.
4102	2	Base on the student' test, plastic type B is the best. Plastic type B ha the highest stretchabl in both test. The student could'v improv their expir by ad weight till the plastic broke & perform a differ test in trail 2.
4103	2	a) I can conclud base on the student data, that plastic type B wa the most stretchable. And plastic type A wa the least stretchable. ^p b) One wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa be, first of all, describ what kind of tape wa us becaus simple, weakest tape would probably, not work in thi situation. The best kind of tape might be duct tape, scratch tape, or measur tape. So that need to be specified. Also, the student should have told us the exact amount of weight that should be us for each plastic if differ amount were place measur would be differ and all inclusive. The design need to be more specific.
4104	2	The plastic type A, B increas except plastic C & D. Plastic A increas from 10 mm to 12mm, plastic B increas from 22mm to 23 mm, plastic D stai the same 20mm, 20mm, plastic C decreas from 14 mm to 13 mm. ^p One wai to improv thi experi is to allow them to hang for more time , Another wai is to run more than two trials.
4105	2	A) Base on the conclus of the student data thei took 4 piec of plastic tape them to an edg of adesk, clape wieght to them and let them hang for 5 minutes. Then measur them to see how long thei have stretched. Thei did thi twice for all four type of plastics. So thei got two result for all of the plastics. B) Two wai the student could of improv their experiment design ar on had at, the same amount of weight on the differ type of plastics. Also thei could of had more trial so thei could of had more results.
4106	2	a) A conclus i can make base on thi data is that all the specif plastic type had veri differ effect by either growing, shrinking, or stai the same.^p (b)Two wai the student could have prove the experi is to includ where exactli thi experi is take place and also the durabl of the tabl be used.
4107	2	I conclud that plastic type A ha the most stretchabl becaus from T1 to T2 it stretch two more mm and the rest did not stretch as much as type A. One wai thi student could have improv the experi design is by ofsonb how much the clamp at the bottom of the plastic sampl should weigh. Another improv need to be in step 5. The student need to specifi what kind of weight ar need and how heavy.
4108	2	The differ plastic type stretch differ A. plastic A in the T1 thei stretch less the the T2 in the plastic B in the trial 2 thei stretch on mm that the trial C the trial, thei stretch more than the trial 2. D thei ar equal.^p B. The two wai the student could have improv to the experiment design or valid of the result is add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minut the other is and then measur the length of the plastic types.
4109	2	The student could have impov thi by be more specif for exampl the could sai how long the piec of plastic is how much weight is be ad to the plastic and to also shoe the type be used.
4110	2	Base on the data i can see that not all of the type of plastic stretched, on type of plastic got smaller and on type stood the same. One wai that the student could have improv the experi is by explain what the four type of plastic were. And second thei could have drawn a graph to show the differ of the plastic befor and after.
4111	2	Base on the data on can conclud that plastic type B ha the highest stretchabl becaus it averag amount stretch is greater than ani other types. ^P Two wai that the student could'v improv the valid of the result would be to cut all out polym to the same length and to add the same amount of weight to everi polymer.
4112	2	"The polym plastic type A & B were stretch 2mm more after trial 2. Plastic type C & D obvious is a total differ type of polym plastic which is not easi to stretch. Plastic type ""C"" decreas 1 mm while plastic type ""D"" stai the same. Thei could of improv there valid by mention how mani weight thei us for each trial & also state the differ type of polym plastics."
4113	2	A) Plastic B ha stretch out the furthest more than ani other plastic I have tested. The least stretch plastic is plastic type A which wa at 10 for T1 and 12 for T2. Type B stretch to 22 in T1 and 23 in T2 at the most stretchability. Type C wa at 14 for T1 and 13 for T2. Lastly, type D wa at type 20mm for T1 and T2 at 20. The student improv by start to find out which polym had the most stretchability. B) One wai the student could have improv the experiment design is to add a control with all polym plastic with stretch it out. Another to improv is to add more for start such as same start length of all plastics, same weight, same surfac area.
4114	2	Base on the data plastic B stretch the most out of all the plastics. So plastic B is the most stretchabl polym plastic out of the four plastics. Plastic A is the least stretchabl becaus it onli stretche10-12mm and plastic B stretch 22-23mm. The student should have state how much weight wa more us and if thei us the same amount of weight for each plastic. Also the plastic should all start out the same length to ensur validity.
4115	2	a) Plastic type B ha the most tensil strength becaus it stretch the farthest in both trials, and plastic type A ha the least tensil strength, becaus it stretch the least in both trials. ^p b) The student could have indic how mani millimet of plastic should be tape on top of the table, and indic how heavi each weight should be.
4116	2	The conclut would be that plastic type D ha strech the most and that plastic type A had strech the least. One wai the student could have improv the exper would be to tell peopl the mass of the weight used. Another thing the student could have done wa to list the start length of the plastic in hi data table.
4117	2	"A conclus base on the student data is ""B"" and ""D"" were measur out to be in the low both. ""A"" and ""C"" were measur in the laend. One wai thei could of improv the design is meser the length of tin plastic befor thei ad weight B. A second wai thei could improv thi design is tell us in the procedur when to measur after ad the weight on."
4118	2	In the polym investig four differ polym plastic were test for their stretchability. In thi experiment, plastic type B stretch the most while plastic type A stretch the least. The result ar reliabl becaus of the two trial the amount stretch onli differ by 2 mm or the most, disrupt our consist in the experiment. To improv thi experiment, I would run a third and fourth trial to develop an averag amount stretch for each plastic type. Additionally, I would make the length of each plastic type the same for a better comparison of each plastic amount stretched.
4119	2	"My conclus would be that plastic A would be the most resist plastic and plastic plastic B would be the stretchiest plastic . One wai the student could have improv the valid of the result could have been to run more trial for the sampl of plastic. One wai to improv the experimentol design would be to chang step 6"" to repeat step 1-5 for the remain three plastic samples'', thi would cous less confus for peopl do thi procedure."
4120	2	A) Base on the student data I conclud that plastic type B wa the stretchiest of all plastic becaus in both trial 1 and 2 it got higher than 20 both time which wa higher for ani other plastic. ^P B) The student could have improv thi experi by have a constant amount of weight as put on all the plastic and he should have had a control group.
4121	2	The experi show that plastic type B ha the most tensil strength, sinc it would have done to improv the experi ar to specifi the amount of weight ad and give specif start length for each plastic, perfeabl the same length for each.
4122	2	Freom thi experi we can conclud that plastic type B stretch the farthest when weight were ad to the pull of gravity. Thei could improv the experi by sai how mani weigh should be ad to the plastic to keep it constant. Also thei could add more trial to increas the validity.
4123	2	A. Base on the result of the experiment, I believ that plastic C will take the most weight. All the other plastic either extend when more weight wa ad or stai the same. Plastic C though actual shrunk in size unlik plastic A which went from 10 to 12 and B which went from 22-23 mm and lastli D witch remain at 20 mm the whole duration. ^p B: A wai the student could of improv the experi valid is by have more trial and have the plastic strip the same length.
4124	2	I conclud that plastic type B ha a stronger materi compar to the other types. ^p One wai the student could have improv their experi is by ad more trials, anoth wai it would have been better is by sai how much weight wa be used.
4125	2	Plastic type B stretch the most. The student could have said how much height thei put on the plastics. Thei could of also mention the amount of time the weight were on the ruler thei could of said now much tape to use.
4126	2	Base on the student data, type D' length stai the same in both trials. Also type B had the highest length, and type A the smallest. Thi lab could be improv by state the purpos of the second trial. Also, sinc there ar 2 trials, the length should be averaged. There also should have been a percis number of weight added.
4127	2	In conclus it seem that the plastic type B' outcom of amount stretch in mm wa the highest against the other three.^p State what length you'r except to keep them the same.^p Also for better result the student should have done a third trial to be on the safe side.
4128	2	a) T2 the amount that wa stretch in wa more than the amount in T1. ^p b) The student could have estim 2.
4129	2	A= As the student where do the right thing but thei could have done it in more detail so we can now a littl more. ^p B=The could have improv it by write how mani time thei did it and record how long thei did it for.
4130	2	"In conclus plastic type B prove to be the most strechabl (after 5 mins) reach ti 22 $ 23 mm stretched. Howevwr plastic type A prove to be the least stretchabl after 5 min reach 10 mm in trial and 17 mm in trial 2. Plastic type B prove to be the second least strechabl and 20 mm at both trial and type C prove to be the second least strechable. After five minut in trial 1 it wa 14mm long and in trial two it wa 13 mm long, ""A"" wa the least stretchabl while ""B"" wa the most stretchable."
4131	2	"The data tabl show us that plastic type ""B"" had stretch the most out of all other plastic type materials. Thi exiper could have more trail and more in format of their producerse."
4132	2	(a) Accord to the student' data plastic B stretch the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial.^p (b). The student should have specifi how much the weight weigh and how mani of them to put on the clamp.^p The student should have specifi what thei were measur the length of the plastic type with.
4133	2	The plastic type did have an effect on the amount stretched. As the plastic stretch from A to D the amount stretch in mm chang from 10 to 20 on the first trail and 12 to 20 on the second trial. I sai plastic B stretch the best becaus it stretch the most at 22 and 23 mm the first and second trials. ^P The student expir wa not valid. Thei could of done more trials. Thei could of told us what type of plastic thei used.
4134	2	base on the experi data, I can conclud that plastic B ha the greatest stretchabl by stretch 22 & 23 mm. the least stabil plastic wa A of onli 10 & 12mm. ^p The student could have improv the experi by ad independent/ depend variables, and complet 3 trial all with equal weights.
4135	2	The plastic stretch a small amount in most in some stai the same.^p He could of ad more weights.^p Wait more times.
4136	2	a) Plastic type B stretch the furthest, therefor it is the most flexible, stretchabl or most like thinnest of all four plastic types. Type B finish with 22mm in the first trial and 23 in the second trial. The least stretchabl plastic type, type A finish with 10mm in the first trial and 12 in the second trial. ^p b) Thi student should'v identifi the length which all four plastic sampl should be to ensur that each is given a fair trial. Also, the student should classifi the size, shape and amount of materi us preferably. Each type of materi should be ident in ensur accuracy.
4137	2	So in thi lab I record four type of plastic type bags. Also I record the amount stretch in the four type of bags. I did two tri each. Two thing thei could improv is their procedur list their data table. Also their result of the amount stretched.
4138	2	a. The student data conclud that plastic type A is the strongest becaus it stretch the least in both trials. ^p b. The student could have made all the plastic the same start length and ad the same amount of weight each time.
4139	2	a) base on the student' data I can conclud that plastic type A stretch the least at 10mm T1 and 10mm on T2. plastic type B stretch the most with 22mm on T1 and 23mm on T2. b) Two wai that the student could improv the experiment design ar set a size a weight to put on the clamp.
4140	2	a) Base on the student' data. Plastic type D wa the on that stretch the most make it the most durable. For example, plastic A onli stretch 10mm, while D stretch to 20mm. Also, the second trial wa import becaus for plastic A.C, differ amount of length wa recorded.^p b) One wai to improv the experi design is to tell how mani weight ar ad to the clamp and how heavi thei are. The student can then us these weight to test anoth trial which would make the design better. Becaus plastic D stretch the same amount in both trials, it'll be best to creat a third trial for each plastic.
4141	2	The conclus that wa made is that plastic type B stretch more in both trial compar to the oth 3 plastic type becaus plastic Type got 22 and 23 mm for both trial while the next best plastic type got 20mm for both trials. The student must includ in the procedur the amount of weight to add for step 4. Also thei should explain more for instanc like what doe the clamp do?
4142	2	Base on the data I can conclud that plastic type B stretch the most out of ani of the other plastics.^p Two wai that the student could have improv the design and /or valid of the result ar by tell us what type of plastics). Second the student should have ad a third part to the table, how much weight wa be applied.
4143	2	The plastic type (B) stretch out the more in both trial than the other type of plastic.^p One wai thei could improv their experi wa to tell us how much weight thei us on the clamps.^p Another on is thei could have written down the length of plastic befor thei start to see the difference.
4144	2	There wasn't much of a differ between (T1) and (T2). It onli stretch like 2mm at most and sometim is even just stai the same. One wai the student could have improv the experi is by do 1 more trial. Another wai the student could have improv the experi is by us sever other materi not just plastic.
4145	2	Base on the student data you can conclud that Plastic B stretch the farthest and Plastic A stretch the least. Two wai thi student could have improv thi experi is by provid the start length of each plastic befor the weight ar added. Another thing thei could do to improv thi experi is to includ the weight that wa ad to the clamp for each plastic.
4146	2	a. Base on the student' data, plastic type B wa the most stretchable. ^p b. First, the student should have mention what type of plastic to us to replic the experiment, and it seem thei us the same piec of plastic for each type on both trials, which could caus inaccuraci becaus the first trial mai have stretch the plastic out too much for the second trial.
4147	2	Base on the student data, my conclus would be that T2 got more result than T1. Two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design by give more results, and measurements.
4148	2	a) Base on the data, the polym plastic B is at the top of the list of stretchabl at about 22.5 mm.^p (b) One wai the student could have improv the valid of the trial could be to add on or two more trials. Also, he could have measur the spot were he put the type so thart each on start at the same spot.
4149	2	Plastic type B stretch the most out of all of the plastics. However, type A is the strongest of all of the plastic becaus it stretch the least and wa abl to support the weights. ^p The student could have specifi how much weight to add to each plastic to keep the trial constant. Thei also should have specifi which sampl thei were us and the size of each sampl to maintain consist throughout trials. Both of these would help improv the valid of the data.
4150	2	The conclus of thi experi is that plastic type B stretch the most with 23 (mm) with trial. ^p 2. A wai to improv thi experi is clarifi what the plastic is test for and if it need to be stretchi or not stretchy. Also to us differ amount of weight to see what the main stretch is. Also a control in thi experi to compar to could help.
4151	2	Base on the student data you can conclud that for the most part all four type of plastic had almost the same length at mm stretch to the two trials. ^p Two wai the student can improv the experi is that thei could sai what the start length for each plastic type would be or thei could increas the amount of time the plastic hang from the tabl by.
4152	2	Well base on the student data plastic type B wa the plastic that stretch the most on both trys. One wai that student could the valditi of her expir would to have a control. Thi wai you have somth to test the other result against.
4153	2	Base on the conclus plastic type B result in the most stretch T1-22, T2-23. conclud that 1/4 it wa the most strongest.Th student should have ad a specif amount of weight to the clamp as the same and conclud the result on the plastic type lastli the student should have perform the second trial with differ measurement.
4154	2	Plastic type B wa the most stretchabl and A wa the least. Want longer than 3 min when ad the weights. Add more weights.
4155	2	The result seem pretti good. And I think that he could have done more data and more samples.
4156	2	From the student data table, on can conclud that plastic type 'B' and 'D' ar more elast / ar abl to stretch more than plastic type 'A' and 'C'. The student could have improv their experi by specifi and control the amount of weight ad to each clamp and mention and maintain the begin dimens of the polym that subject (includ thickness.)
4157	2	a) A conclus that can be drawn from the student data can be that plastic type D ha the most stretchabl in both trials.^p b) Two wai the student could have improv the experi design/valid of the result could be: (1) show each of the plastic origin length befor the trials. (2) If thei did a 3rd trial with a longer time of heavier weights.
4158	2	"From the graph shown I feel that plastic type ""B"" wa more durabl than the other plastic becaus at trial 1 it wa the highest mm stretch and some for trial 2. ^P B. Two wai the student could have improv the design is to do more than just 2 trials. Thei could'v also done it in differ measurements."
4159	2	A. I could conclud from thi student experi that plastic B, wa the stretchiest. B. The student could have made their experi more reliabl by specifi the amount of weight and ad a control on even state how far to put the piec of plastic over the table.
4160	2	a) With the result provided, it is shown that plastic type B stretch the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second, compar to plastic A thi is about 11.5mm more stretchy. B) The student should have specifi the weight amount that wa to be ad to the plastic. Thei should have also said how much of the plastic should be tape to the table, differ amount could affect the amount of weight it could hold.
4161	2	In conclusson, plastic type D ha the most stretchability. Two wai that student could improv the experi is by have a control. Thei could also do more trial to receiv a more acuret answer.
4162	2	a) Plastic type B stretch the furthest in both trials. Therefore, it would most like break faster than the others. Plastic type A stretch the least amount so, it would probabl hold more befor breaking. B) The student could have perform more trials. Thei could'v also, us the same amount of weight each trial and for each plastic. It doesn't sai how much weight thei used, just to add weights.
4163	2	a. In conclus if I take a sampl of a type of plastic and measur it length then add weight to it and wait 5 minut to see how much it is now.^p b. Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is to add more trials. Another thing thei could of did wa try is add more thing for the weights.
4164	2	The student do polym lab can now know plastic type B had stretch the most and plastic type A had stretch the least. The second polym had the greatest stretchability. Two wai thei could have improv the design is take the plastic over a cylindr surfac that open and put weight on it to see if that affect it more. Also for better valid of their data thei could'v put how the plastic measur befor and after instead of alreadi skip to the math part.
4165	2	In the data tabl there ar four differ kind of plastic type and thei had to be stretch by weights, within both trial there wasn't realli a differ just that plastic type b had the longest trail. Thei could have told us what type of plastic wrap thei us and thei should have more trials.
4166	2	a)Mi conclus is that plastic type B had the most stretchabl out of all the test plastics. I came to thi conclus becaus as you see on the graph on T1 it reach 22 and T2 23 which wa higher than all the other plastic tested.^p (b) Thei could have did more trial becaus the more thei do, the more accur there result are. Lastly, in the procedur when it sai measur thei should list the unit thei wanna use.
4167	2	(a)1 Plastic 1 B stretch the most, so it would be best to carri heavier objects. ^p (b)1 Tell what kind of plastic thei us were: ^p 2 Be more detail by how long thei stretch it for.
4168	2	Overal plastic B stretch the most follow by plastic D, C, then A. Thi lab need a lot of work for it to be valid. First the amount of weight need to be recorded. Also the origion length of the 4 plastic need to be on the tabl becaus although plastic B is the longest in the end, it mai have start at 20mm, but we don't know. Also thei should do more trials.
4169	2	What I can conclud from the group result is that polym B ha the least amount of resist to stretching. I know thi because, plastic type B stretch an averag length of 22.5 mm, thi is larger than the three other plastics. Also, plastic type A had the most resist to stretch becaus it onli stretch an averag length of b11mm. There is two wai to add valid and imped the experiment design. One wai is to add a control to the group and second, to have specif measur for the amount of weight be added.
4170	2	The student could have improv the experi design and valid of the result is add more weight to the clamp and take more time to chang the data table.
4171	2	Base on the student data, plastic B and D ar the most stretchabl becaus thei stretch the most in trial 1. Plastic B stretch 22 mm and plastic D stretch 20 mm. ^p The student could have specifi how heavi the weight should be on the plastics. Also the student must us plastic sampl of the same length so the result have more validity.
4172	2	What kind of plastic wa it.
4173	2	You can conclud that plastic B stretch the most, and plastic A stretch the least. One wai the experi could be improvd is make sure each plastic is the same length befor the stretch. Another is to do the experi for differ time intervals, like five, ten, and fifteen minut instead of just five minutes.
4174	2	Base on the data, we can conclud that plastic type A is the strongest of the four. One wai the student could have improv thi experiment, would be to first measur a specif amount all of the plastic types. He could also specif state the amount and heavi of the weight & also make that a control.
4175	2	A conclus I can draw base on the student data is that plastic type A stretch the shortest amount and that plastic type D didn't stretch at all but stretch the longest out of thin four types. One wai that thi design could have been improv is if the plastic type could have been name and the procedur should have ad now high the tabl wa in order to make the experi work better.
4176	2	Plastic D it not even strectch. ^p B- includ sofleg make is and start with the same mass for the plastic hags.
4177	2	The student' data wa veri accur and it show the less trech plastic as well as the stretchiest plastic type. In the end the student could have improv the experi by ad more trial to the experiment. Also more weigh on the plastic to have more accur ressults.
4178	2	The student data is good the trial were cole in number. It seem that plastic type B wa the strech with a lenth of 22 and 23 so the two trial help the way. ^P I he procedur he doe not tell you what to meser in. He said to put a weight on the end but how much.
4179	2	The conclus of thi investig is that plastic type A is the most provabl becaus it stretch the most out of the four types. The student could have improv thi investig by us all plastic type that were the same length. Also the student could have extend the stand time for trial 2.
4180	2	a) The more weight that wa ad onto the plastic bag and on longer the weight were on the plastic bag, the more it had strech out. Out of all the plastic bag type D had the least amount of resist to be streched, plastic bag type A had the most amount of resist to be streched. ^P b) One wai that the experi could have been improv wa the amount of weight could have been specified. A second wai that the experi could have been improv wa more trial could have been conducted.
4181	2	a) Plastic type A & C ar the least stretchy, wherea plastic type B & D ar the most stretchy.^p 1 b) Defin the origin length as the plastic, and keep it constant for all four plastics. 2b) Use differ size weight for the trial to see if their is a differ in data.
4182	2	A conclus that be drawn from the data tabl is that the, plastic type B had the most weight although thei could have improv their experi by. Clamp ar side to a table, which the other side wa clamp someth that held the weight thei also could'v includ the bag type and lenghth and width.
4183	2	a) In conclusion, plastic type B stretch more than plastic type A, C, & D. The purpos of thi experi wa to test four differ polym plastic for stretchability. Data show that plastic type c stretch more than plastic type A, but plastic B stretch more than all of the plastic types. The student could have improv their design by label the plastic by name and ad it to procedure.
4184	2	a) Base on the record data, I am abl to conclud that plastic B wa a weak poli ethilen product in which it ha the highest stretchabl through out the experiment. ^p The group could deffinetli improv their design by have each sampl of plastic at a constant length, therefor your result ar more valid. Also the group could creat interv of time to show the result after 5, 10, or 15 minut to see the fluctuation.
4185	2	a) Base on the student data, I can conclud the B stretch the highest and A stretch the least. ^P b) The student could have told us how much the weight weighed. Thei also could have told us the origin length of the plastic befor stretch it.
4186	2	The student should have made the procedur less.
4187	2	a) I conclud that plastic B wa the highest stretch plastic accord to the graph it stretch 23mm, plastic A is the least stretchabl plastic it stretch onli 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in trial two. ^P b) Thi experi could have been improv by have each plastic stort at the same length and have the same amount of weight put on each plastic. The chart should includ the origin start length of each of the plastic and the end length.
4188	2	A.) Plastic type B stretch the most. ^p B.) Thei could have done multipl trial of each plastic.
4189	2	a) Basic these student ar try to see which on of these bag ar more durabl than the other how much weight it can take. ^p b) The first wai the student could have improv is that the could have measur the plastic and the second wai thei could have improv is to see how long thei should leav it on befor the bag break.
4190	2	In conclus the plastic materi that wa test had a small amount of stretchability. In the experi the plastic wa strech at least 1mor millamet greater in the second trial versu the first trial also plastic type D wa the onli plastic that had no chang within the two trials. Know two thing I would chang is first have the start length of the plastic to see the differ from start to finish. Also specifi how much weight you ar lai on the end of the plastic.
4191	2	In conclusion, the plastic type have more amout stretch that the other on in both trial. For exampl in the first on he had 22 and the second he had 23.
4192	2	A conclus drown base on the students' data would be plastic type B stretch the most. One wai the student could have improv the valid of the result is to have each type of plastic start at the same length. The student could have improv their experi by put the same amount of weight on each plastic.
4193	2	a) My conclus is that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p To make thi experi more exact like should have been more trial and their should also have a control test.
4194	2	As shown in the data, most of the test subject stretch by one, with so, thi project wa a success. ^p 1. He could have us more time on the weights. ^p 2. He could have us differ weights.
4195	2	a. Plastic B stretch the most at an avarag of 22.5 mm. ^p b. Add more trials. Explain how much waight ar thei using. How much of tape to use.
4196	2	A) In conclus it seem as though plastic type D wa the weakest plastic be least, as it stretch 20mm in each trial. The strongest appear to be plastic A, which bare stretched; it wa as an averag of 11mm.^p b) One wai that the student would'v made thi experi wa to make sure the weight thei were us were kept constant, as thi could easili affect how much the plastic stretched. A second wai the student could'v improv these experi would be to add weight and the drop of the bottom at the same time, then immedi start take so all the vinegar be us is both constant as well as the amount of time it' left hang pf the plastic.
4197	2	Plastic type B ha the most stretchabl and plastic type A stretch onli 10 and 12 mm for each trial and plastic type B stretch 22 mm and 23 mm for each trial. ^p Two wai to improv thi experiment. Thei probabl should not us tape to hold the plastic on the tabl and thei should try differ amount of weight for differ times.
4198	2	The conclus of the differ plastic is that mostli all the stretch further in the second trial then the first trial.^p One wa the student could have improv the experiment design is instead of us a clamp, just us the weights. And a second wai the student could have improv the experiment design measur all plastic befor anyth else.
4199	2	Base on the data tabl I can conclud that plastic type A wa a weaker or thinner plastic sinc it had stretch out the most. Also that plastic type D wa strongest due to the fact that it didn't stretch at all. A valid issu is that plastic type C had shrunk in size when the test wa to see it stretch.
4200	2	a. The conclus I came to is that plastic type D ha the least strength there for it stretch the most. ^p The student could have specifi how mani weight to add into each clamp. The student also could'v made each sampl of plastic the same length so it would have been easier to measur and conclud how much the plastic stretched.
4201	2	A.) That type B plastic is the strogest type of plastic thei us in thi investigation. It held the same while strech the most.^p B.) One wai thei could have improv there data is which wai the plastic wa held with or against which ha a big import. Also thei did not state how much weight.
4202	2	3A) I would conclud that with basicli all the plastic that ar be us in the experiment. Thei ar all veri close in the amount stretch when thei ar all the same plastic type from T1 to T2. ^p 3b) And two wai that a student could have improv the experi wa mayb have a T3 to see if it would chang ani of the data anyth and keep the weight and clamp till it broke to realli see how much it stretched.
4203	2	My conclus is that the number will go higher low and a wai thei can improv the trial is by put more work in it, so it can be a good grade or data count.
4204	2	My conclus is that for each plastic type it had stretch almost the exact same amount for both trial such as type D which had 20 for both trials. The student could have improv the experiment design by be specif as to how mani weight should be added. Thei also should have written how far the cup should be hang and to record their data.
4205	2	a. Base on the data, it can be conclud that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b. The student should have improv the experiment design by be more specif and indic how much weight wa ad to the clamp. Also, the student could have experi further by also test the length of the bag after a longer period of time like 10 minutes.
4206	2	a) The tabl doesn't tell you much about how much thei exactli stretched, the student onli put what I assum the end length of the marble. Noth can realli be told with thi information.^p (b) Thei should mention the type of plastic in the procedur becaus it not clear as to what materi thei ar refer to. Also thei should have mention thi in the table. On the table, the origin length should have been record becaus otherwis you cannot tell how much it actual stretched.
4207	2	a) It is clear that plastic D is the least elast and that plastic A is the most elast plastic. ^p b) To improv the valid of the result the student could have done a third trial. And could have specifi what the length wa at each weight.
4208	2	a) In conclus in the procedur it can be seen that plastic type A had the biggest differ in stretchabl over the other polym plastics.^p b) Two wai the student could have improv the experi ar in either add more weight to the plastic or to let the weight be off the plastic for more than five minutes.
4209	2	"A. The conclus that I drew is plastic type ""B"" wa the best plastic for stretchability"". ^P B. One wai the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much weight to add to the clamp. The result won't be as valid if on person add a differ amount of weight than another. ^P Another wai the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much (in mm) of the bag should be tape to the table."
4210	2	Base on the student data for each trial, the amount of plastic stretched, it would first rise, decreased, then rise again. ^P B.) 1.) For the experiment design, thei could have explain how much do the weight weighed. ^P 2.) The student should'v show what type of plastic he used.
4211	2	a) Plastic type B is the plastic that stretch the most, plastic A wa the on that stretch the least.^p b) The student can improv the experi by ad anoth trial. Also we could have mention how much weight he put on the clamp.
4212	2	Base on the student data all of the type of plastic manag to stai around the same amount of be stretched. ^p I, the student could have shown constants, 2.)The student could have explain how the experi wa done a littl bit more.
4213	2	Base on the student data I could conclud that the materi that can stretch the most is plastic B. That becaus it wa abl to stretch 22mm the first trial and 23m the second trial.^ (b)The student could have put the tabl what kind of plastic that were be used. In the procedur the student should have put how much the weight weighed.
4214	2	(1) He could of us the same amount of weight. ^p (2) Use a differ conteince.
4215	2	The student data show that plastic B stretch the most (22mm & 23 mm), howev thi mai not be valid becaus you don't know if the length affect thi amount of stretch caus by the weights. The student can improv the result by us the same length for each plastic. Also, thei can includ how much weight to add to the drop in the procedur to improv the experiment design.
4216	2	A)A conclus base on the student' data is plastic type D had the same amount stretch for trial on and two, which wa 20(mm).^p (b)Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and the valid is by keep the sampl piec of the type of plastic the same. Also to us the same type of weights.
4217	2	a. Base on the student data plastic A stretch 2mm, plastic B stretch 1mm, plastic C didn't stretch it got stretch by 1mm and plastic D didn't chang at all. ^P b. Two wai that the student could have improv the experi design and/or valid of the result is, first by make the procedur more clear. Second, to make it more accur the amount of weight should be the same sinc you'r not measur that and plastic should of been made of the same type of material.
4218	2	In the student experi it is clear that polym B is the most stretchable, than D, C, and last A. The student could us more trials, with these the experi becom more valid. The student also could have said the size of the plastic sample, sinc the size is in the final measurement, thi could alter the result by a lot.
4219	2	(a) Polym base plastic D didnt stretch at all. Plastic A stretch the most. ^p (b) Run more trial to make sure you get the same or close result and let the weight sit on the plastic longer than five minut to see if more time is givin will it strech more.
4220	2	"A) Plastic type A and B have increas in length from the first trial to the second trial. While type C have decreas and type D have remain the same length. B) Two wai would have to be ) add a certain amount of weight to hang instead of saying, in step 4, add ""weights"". Anyon who is recreat thi experi would have differ amounts. And 2) add more trials, ad will help other underst and read the data more clearly."
4221	2	A) Base on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchy, at 22.5mm average.^p B) The student could have improv the experi by specifi the amount of weight us and the locat on the tabl to put the tape, in case it is move by the weights.
4222	2	A) B first the on plastic that' the stretchiest, while A is the least stretchiest C. ^P B) One wai is by have a third trial to make shure, your data is correct and by take down how long the plastic wa befor you stretch it.
4223	2	Plastic B stretch the most for both trials.On trial on it stretch 22mm, on trial 2 it stretch 23mm.The plastic that stretch the least ha plastic A. On trial 1 it stretch on trial 2 stretch 12mm. A wai the student could have improv thi is to add more weight to each plastic. And also anoth wa to improv it is to have the plastic start at the same length.
4224	2	a) Base on the student data plastic type D is the constant and will alwai be ^p 20mm but B is stretchies. ^p b) Two wai the student could have improv thi would have been to indentifi the type of plastic and how much weight wa be added.
4225	2	In conclusion,th data show that plastic. Type B ha the best stretchabl in thi experiment. ^p The student could have improv the experi by explain what brand plastic he us for the experiment. He could have list the materi be us in the experiment.
4226	2	A. To conclude, base on the data plastic type B ha the most stretchability. Plastic type B wa abl to stretch 22 and 23mm while the closest strech (plastic type A) stretch 20 and 20.^p B. The student could have improv the experi by tell a specif amount of weight and by be specif on what type of plastic thei ar using.
4227	2	b)The first would be to do second trial(t2) differ then the first trial(t1) to be abl to understand the differ of both experiment/ second would be to conduct a longer time set to see how long it last.
4228	2	"a) Base on the student' data I can tell that plastic type B ha the highest stretchabl i. lasticity. Thi is becaus B had stretch to 22 mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial2 which wa more than other plastic types. b) One wai the student could have taken each sampl and measur how long it origin wa instead of onli "" measur the length of plastic types"" for "" three plastic samples"". Also, the student could have had a third trial instead of just trial 1 and trial 2, make the result more valid."
4229	2	In plastic type A there wa a two milimet increas between T1 and T2. Plastic type B onli increas by on in it two trials. Type C had a decreas of on in the trial and D show no sign of change. Plastic A seem to be the most stretchabl polymer. These student could have improv their experi by keep the clamp and the weight on the plastic, stretch it and then measur to test the durabl of the polym as well.
4230	2	A conclus base on the student' data is plastic type B stretch the most with a stretch of 23mm wherea all the other plastic stretch less than 20mm. Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and/or valid of the result ar to run more trial and in the instruct give a certain length or size of the plastic type becaus on plastic mayb stronger with more size give you unaccur results.
4231	2	a) You can't realli draw a conclus because, the length of the materi (befor it wa stretched) wa not recorded. But the plastic with the biggest is plastic B and the least is plastc A.^p b) Thei could measur the plastic befor stretch and determin how larg the weight should be.
4232	2	a) A good conclut for thi would be that type be strech the furthest. ^P b) Two wai the student could have made thi better would to have test exactli what type of plastic to us and how long each peic should be.
4233	2	a.) In conclusion, plastic type A and B increas two or on mm. Plastic type C decreas on mm. And lastli plastic. Type D stai the same. So the onli affect on were plastic type A, B, and C. ^p b.) One wai the student could improv wa to have anoth trial. And a second wai the student could improv wa to add differ weights.
4234	2	The strongest plastic type wa it becaus it stretch the most in both trials. The weakest wa b becaus it stretch the most in both trials. So two wai thei could have been improv wa stai long in a special place on the plastic and us the same clamps.
4235	2	(A) Base on the data graph it is clear the polym B is the most strecthabl becaus in T1 it stretch 22 cm and in T2 it strectch 23cm, beat the other polymers. ^p (B) The two wai thei could have better thi project is by 1, add more trial to it and 2. Thei could have valid more by write their hypothesi to their experiment.
4236	2	My conclus about thi experi is that T1 doesn't strech more than T2 and all type of plastic have more strech of equal than each other. Student could improv their result by make more step to see what could happ for the next type of plastic if thei stai the same lik plastic D or change.
4237	2	A conclus that can be drawn base on the data is that plastic B ha the best stretchabl becaus their averag amount stretch wa at least 2.5mm more than ani of the other plastics. However, base on the procedur the data is not complet reliable. One wai to make it more reliabl would be to make the weight ad to the clamp constant becaus otherwis more weight could stretch the plastic farther, creat more than on independ variable. Another wai to improv the valid of the result would be to add a control, for exampl a clamp with no weight for each type of plastic, to ensur that the independ variable, the plastic type, is what affect the depend variable, the amount the plastic stretches.
4238	2	a) In conclus put the weight on each state, caus the plastic to stretch. It didn't stretch massiv but it did make a difference. ^p b) One wai the student could chang it' experi is by sai how much weight wa on each state, or the student could have ad the type of plastic samples.
4239	2	(a) The conclus that could be drawn from the data is that after vet the plastic hang for 5 minutes, attatch to a clamp and weights, plastic B had the most stretchability. It stretch to 22mm in the first trial, and 23mm in the second. It wa stretch 12 mm than plastic type A, the least stretchabl plastic, in trial 2, and 11 more mm in the second trial. ^p (b) To improv the valid of the data, the student could have kept the start length of the plastic constant, and the weight of the weight ad to the clamp, keep vairabl constant will bring at more valid results.
4240	2	Plastic type A had the least stretchabl at an averag of 11 mm while plastic type B stretch the most averag at 22.5 mm. ^p The amount of weight ad should be includ in the procedur to make the test more valid. Preform more trial will alwai make an experi more valid in that could help here.
4241	2	It wa conclud that plastic type B stretch the most amount in both the second and first trial. The student could have improv the experi by ad more trial and have a control variables.
4242	2	Base on the student' data you can conclud that plastic type A ha the most strechibl while plastic type C wa the least amount stretch in the two trial while plastic type A' amount strech increas 2mm. Plastic type B' amount strech decreas 1mm two wai the student could have improv the experi of design and/or valid of the result would be by ad weight and let them hang for differ period of time and try to strech them in differ ways.
4243	2	A) Depend on the type of plastic will determin how much it will stretch with the ad weight on it.^P B) The student could have tri it more time and thei could have other type of plastic as well
4244	2	My conclus ar that plastic type B is the strechiest. It' the most durabl and can hold the most height. ^P 1. Use the most durabl tape you can find strong duet tape will probabl be fine. ^P 2. Make sure all the plastic piec ar the same size and appropri size.
4245	2	I conclud that plastic B ha the most stretchability. ^p B) All the plastic should have been the same length to begin with and make sure the same amount of weight is be put on the differ type of plastics.
4246	2	Type D is the stretchiest & most constant of the plastic tell how much weight to put on clamps, tell how long the sampl was.
4247	2	In conclusion, in trial2 the plastic stretch more than in trial .^p B) The student could of improv by indic what kind of plastic and by allow to let them hang longer.
4248	2	Plastic type B ha the best stretchability. Plastic type D wa in 2nd place with 20 mm for both trials. Plastic type C had 14mm for trial 1 and 13mm for trial 2. Plastic type A wa the second. So plastic type B, with 22mm fro trial 1 and 23 for trial 2, is the winner.^p The student could have said how much weight is in the test. Another improv could be to have 2 peopl and stretch the plastic, sinc stretchabl is be tested.
4249	2	a) If plastic type ar ad weight to stretch the plastic B will stretch the farthest. Thi is support by the data becaus in T1 and T2 it stretch the mo 22mm and 23mm ^p b)First thei should have measur the in trial length so there is no confus data.Thei also should have add more trial to improv the valid of the experiment.
4250	2	a) Accord to the data, plastic A wa the strongest becaus it stretch the least; it stretch 10mm the first time and 12mm the second time. Plastic C wa the second strongest, follow by plastic D and then plastic B. ^p b) The student could have us the same weight or same amount of forc on each bag. Also, the student could have us the same size plastic for each plastic and each trial.
4251	2	A) Accord to the student data, polym B stretch the most. ^P B) The student should specifi the exact amount of weight to be attach to the plastic. The student should also specifi which direct the plastic should be stretched, horizont or vertically, becaus the direct of the polym chain affect the stretchi of the plastic. For example, a plastic shop bag tear easili from top to bottom but doe not tear easili from side to side becaus the polym chain ar run top to bottom.
4252	2	A. In conclus plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. Plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. ^p B. The student could'v improv their experiment design by specifi the length of the plastic and by specifi how much the weight weighed.
4253	2	In trial 2 plastic type A stretch 2more millimet than in trial , and plastic type D did not have ani change. ^p The student could have complet more trials. Also the student could have how mani weight befor breaking.
4254	2	A) A conclus is that plastic type B ha stretch the farthest in both trial 1 reach 22mm and in trial 2 reach 23mm. The other 3 plastic type did not stretch as far as plastic B.^P B) The student could have improv the experi by record how long the plastic were befor thei were stretch and ad that data in the table. Also the student could have made sure each plastic wa the same length and width befor each of them were stretched. The student should have also list the weight of the weight she us to stretch the plastic.
4255	2	A conclus that can be drawn from thi experi is that in both on plastic type B ha to stretch larger than my op the other three plastics. Thi data is not valid becaus there ar mani place within the experi to increas the validity. The student could have record the start length and end length. Also thei should have add the amount of weight a control variabl and lost but not least the group should have had a third trial.
4256	2	Plastic B is the easiliest streach plastic. ^p Thei could have done annoth tryal with a differ amount of weight. Thei could have test more samples.
4257	2	A. Base on the student' data the conclus that can be drawn is that plastic, type B had the most stretchability.^p B. Two wai the student could have improv the experi would be to includ exactli what plastic were used. Also thei could have ad what step weight thei us to stretch the plastics.
4258	2	a) Base on the data ,I can assum that plastic B ha the most stretchabl becaus on both trial it stretch 21 and 23mm while the next closest onli stretch 20mm.^p b) One wai the student could here improv the experi design is to start with the same length of each plastic without othei ar constant .Also the student could have specifi the amount of weight that wa out on the clamp and the student could also have made the amount of weight a constant.
4259	2	In trial 1v trial 2 there wasn't a tremend differ in lengths. If anyth happen at all the length rise about 10 12 millimeters. Sampl A had the least amount of millimet but chang the most, while sampl D had the most amount of millimet and didn't chang at all. ^p 1 Use differ sampl of the same plastic for second trial. ^p 2 Make sure thei ar all come from same temperature.
4260	2	A)Plastic type B stretch more than ani type in both of it trials. (B)The student could have made sure each plastic wa the same size to begin with. Also the student could have ad the premier measur to the chart, so he/sh could draw more accur conclusions.
4261	2	Draw a investig is meatanese.
4262	2	a) After record the data, it is obviou that plastic type B can stretch the furthest and plastic type A stretch the least furthest. ^P b) One thing he could have done to improv hi experi wa to list the weight as the weight becaus if there were differ weight the entir experi is forfeit. Another thing he could have done wa to list the origin length of plastic to see how much it actual stretched.
4263	2	C. A conclus base on the student data is that plastic B, C ar the most resistant. ^p The student could improv the experi by try it a third time, and sai the amount of plastic us for all 4 plastic used. Thi is how the student can improv the experi to have a more valid result.
4264	2	Base on the student data, polym plastic type B ha the most stretchability. Thi is becaus the millimet stretch on B trial 1 and 2 exeed that of ani other plastic (22mm & 23mm). The student could have includ a third trial to increas the valid of the experiment. The student also could made sure each sampl of plastic began at the same length. (control)
4265	2	a) The A plastic stretch the most while plastic C shrunk an inch and D did not stretch at all. B stretch an inch conclud that A wa the most stretchabl plastic. ^p b) Thei could have said how long to cut the plastic type and how much weight should be put on the clamp.
4266	2	Base on the inform from the table, plastic type A ha more stretchabl than the rest. ^p The student could'v test longer becaus like I said before, time is a factor in determin thing when testing. Also, the student should'v ad weight to the second trial.
4267	2	I can conclud that plastic B streatch out the most and plastic A streach out the least. I know thi becaus plastic B streatch 22 to 23, and plastic A streach 10-12. Two wa to improv thi experi is to tell what type of plastic, and to add four more trials.
4268	2	Plastic B is a materi that is the most flexible. ^p Two wai the student could have improv thi experi is have a control and measur all the plastic the same length when the experi initiated. A control will allow the student to compar data & the constant will increas the data' validity.
4269	2	A. The polym materi B wa the best in stretchability. The polym D wa 3rd C wa 2nd and A wa the worst.^p B. 1. Thei could have gave the polym more time to stretch instead of just 5 min. 2. Thei could have done test differ polymers.
4270	2	The plastic did not stretch as much in trial 2 (T2) as thei did in trial 1 (T1).^p The student could'v explain what we were look for mayb with a hypothesis. Thei also could'v identifi the plastic types.
4271	2	Base on the data shown in the table, I can conclu that plastic type D wa to strech the most. Also that plastic type A strech the least. ^p The student could have improv the experiment design and/or valid of the result by do more trial and by tell the type of plasic us for the experiment.
4272	2	The need more trails. Also could more infomation, and the most strech ploymer wa 23.
4273	2	It is a good experi with nice idea and it show which plastic is most flexible. The first wai to improv the test is to us differ brand name plastic to test the difference. Neat you need to do 3 trial to see if the lab is valid.
4274	2	Plastic type A is defin the streatchiest where as plastic type D is the least stretchy. The student could have improv hi experi in mani ways. 2 of these wai include: let the plastic stretch more. The student should have wait longer than 5 minutes. The other wai he/sh could have improv the experi is by: have a greater varieti of plastics. The student onli test 4 type of plastic when there ar mani more.
4275	2	The plastic stretch out about the same thei don't have that much difference. The student could have kept ad weight to see how far the plastic would stretch. Thei should have gone deeper and actual figur out the exact difference.
4276	2	The student' data clearli show tat plastic B ha the most stretchability. In that on it stretch to 22 mm, and in trial two it stretch to 23. Plastic D wa a close second with 20 mm for both trials. Plastic C stretch 14 mm the first trial and 13 the second. Final plastic A stretch the least. It is obviou that plastic B wa the stretchiest in Comparison to the other with 10 mm in the first trial and 12 in the second. To improv the experiment design of the student could make sure the piec of plastic ar the same length also thei could us the same clamp and weight to ensur that the weigth ad
4277	2	Base on the student' data, it is clear that plastic type B is the most stretchi becaus it wa abl to stretch 22mm and 23mm. Plastic type A wa the least stretchabl becaus it wa onli stretch 10mm and 12mm. Thi is a differ of about 10mm. ^p The student should have specifi the length of the plastic make it consist for all the differ type would ensur a valid experi in which onli on variabl wa tested. Also, thei should have given a specif weight to be ad to the clamp measur thi you would have made the experi more valid.
4278	2	A) A conclus that could wiad from the student data is that trial 1 and trial 2 both basic had the same number if it could be on higher or on lower. Also, the plastic type D is the most stretchabl to both trials. ^p B) The student could have improv the experi design or valid of the result by not onli try on experiment, test it in four 1-10 trials. Also the student could have been more specif with the plastic types.
4279	2	Base on the student' data I can conclud that plastic A stretch the farthest out of all the other type dure the second trial. Another conclus would be that plastic type D didn't stretch at all and stai durable, which mean it' the strongest, throughout the 1st and the 2nd trial. Two wai thi experi would be obtain at minimum 3 trial to test it valid and the other would be to identifi the type of plastic and more importantli start at the same length of each plastic to keep the valid of the experi valid.
4280	2	As you can see, plastic type A stretch the least and type B stretch the most. 2 wai the student could have improv the experi design would be to tell whatt. Thei ar do with the plastic and do a third trial. The purpos of the experi is unknown.
4281	2	Accord to the student data we can now conclud that plastic B is the strechiest, Strech 22mm and 23mm on the second trial. But on wai the student could have emprov their expeir is with in the procedur thei should make it cleat that you need to have two of the same type of plastic for both trial so your not us the same one. Another wai it could be improv is to explain how mezi and how much weight is be us and specifi that each plastic should us the same weight.
4282	2	a. In conclusion, plastic B wa the most stretchabl out of the group of plastic becaus in trial 1, plastic B stretch 22mm and in trial 2, plastic B stretch 23mm. Thi compar to plastic A, that stretch 10mm on the first trial, and 12mm on the second trial, which wa the least stretchable. ^p b) The student conduct thi experi could have name specif plastic instead of sai 'take a sampl of plastic'. Also, the student could have taken measur as the 5 minut were passing. Multipl trial would have also help prove the valid of thi investigation.
4283	2	a) Conclus - plastic Type A stretch the least and plastic Type D the most. ^p 1. name type of plastic be us 2. what kind of weight ar be used.
4284	2	Base on the student data, plastic type B wa the most flexibl plastic A strech the least with an averag growth of 11mm while in comparison, plastic B had an averag strech of 22.5mm. ^p Two wai the student could improv the experi design and be the valid of the experi are, specifi the a from of weight us and on anoth trial with heavier weights. Thi will further parsu the plan and make sure all data accurate. Another thing the student could do to enhanc the valid of the experi is to start out with the same amount of each platic, instead of measur differ length to start with.
4285	2	In conclus plastic type B had the best flexibl of 22-23mm amount stretched, while A had 10-12mm,C had 14-13mm,and D had 20-20mm stretched. So type B the best. Two wai improv their experi is by us someth other than a clamp, that also add on weight ,and to show on their data tabl how much weight the stretch could withstand.
4286	2	Base on the student' data, I can make a conclus that plastic type B stretch the most. Two wai to improv thi experi for better result is on have a control. Thei also can have more trial to make it more valid.
4287	2	I can draw a conclus that A had the best stretchabl with T1=22 and T2=23. I am also conclud that plastic A had the best stretchabl at T1=10, T2=12, what the student could have done to test her valid she could have had the amount of weight and she could have give the name of the plastic.
4288	2	Thei could of allow the clamp to hang for 10 minutes. Thei could of put more weight on the clamp.
4289	2	A) Base on the student' data plastic B wa the plastic that stretch the longest in both trial becaus it went 22mm and plastic A onli went 10mm. In trial 2 plastic B went 23mm and plastic D onli went 20mm. ^p B) Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design ar by tell us how much weight to put in the clamp and have the averag of both trials.
4290	2	Plastic type B stretch the most compar to the other plastic while plastic C did not stretch at all. The student could improv the experi by list the start measur of each plastic and perform three trial instead of 2.
4291	2	A conclus I can make base on the student' pould data is that plastic type B wa abl to be stretch the farthest. Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and the valid of the result is you should try the experi at differ temperatur ( not stretch the plastic would cold compress the item of the polymer) and list the weight thei us (how heavi thei were).
4292	2	a)From thi inform I come to conclud plastic type B stretch the most out the four types. Plastic type D came next, then C, the A.^p (b)Thi student could made thi lab better in two ways, thei could have told us how much weight to put on the plastics, and thei could have explain more how to measur it, with inch or milimeters.
4293	2	A) In conclusion, plastic type B ha the most stretchabl with an averag of 22.5 mm stretch, follow by plastic type D, averag 20 mm, then plastic type C, averag 13.5 mm, then the plastic with the lowest stretchabl wa plastic type A, averag 11 mm of stretch. ^P B) The student could have improv the experi design or valid of the result by includ that all the plastic type were equal cut and measure. Thei could have also includ to us the same amount of weight for each trial or experiment.
4294	2	In conclus the graph shown state that plastic (type B) strech the most compar to the rest of the type of plastic. ^P One wai the student can improv thi experi would he to us the same weight for each type of plastic. Another wai would be to cut the same size of plastic for each type and trial.
4295	2	A)Plastic type D stretch the most .^p Thei could have done 3 trial instead of two. Thei could have told you the weight measurement.
4296	2	"Plastic type A, B, C, and D all stretch out over 10 mm in the first trial. On the second trial plastic type ""C"" stretch out onli 13mm less than trial one. ^p Constant amount of weight. Thei could have also improv it by more trials."
4297	2	a. Base on the student data I can conclud that the plastic bag B and D ar the least desir bag becaus thei stretch far when the warm and weight were ad plastic bag A and C where the most durabl becaus thei eld most stretch as far when the weight were added. (b) One wai the student could have improv the their design is by make all the bag length the same. The student also could have made the weight a specif number so that all the type of plastic had the same amount of weight pull on it.
4298	2	Base on the data I would sai that plastic type B streach the most for both trials.^p The student didn't tell how big the weight were and thei didn't have a control test.
4299	2	a.) Base on the student' data, plastic type B had the most stretchabilty, or wa the stretchiest plastic.^p b.) The student could have us a control, for exampl a non plastic to compar the stretchabilti and to help make a better conclus and analysts. The student could have us the same amount of weight for each plastic and each trial, so that thei wouldn't us more and differ plastic and to ensur the accuracy/valid of their data.
4300	2	Plastic B wa the strongest out of all four plastics. Two wai that the experi could have been improv is to have more trial and specif measurements.
4301	2	The student could have improv the experiment design and/or valid as the result and mave to decreas the differ as amount stretch an up from T1 to T2.
4302	2	A) I can conclud that plastic A stretch the longest (2mm) and that plastic C did not stretch, but decreas in length from 14mm to 13mm (1mm). ^p B) Student could measur all the plastic aat the onc and thei could do someth else.
4303	2	The tabl show that plastic type B stretch the most out of all of the plastic types. Plastic type B stretch 22mm in trial on and stretch 23mm in trial two. Plastic type D stretch 20mm in both trials, them plastic type C stretch 14mm in trial on and 13mm in trial two and plastic Type A stretch 10mm in trial on and 12mm in trial two. Two wai that the student could have improv their experi design and/on valid of the result ar that thei could have us the exact same weight everytim and said what type pf plastic thei used.
4304	2	a) Plastic will stretch and bend when weight is be appli to on end caus the plastic to be changed. ^p b) The student could have list the type of plastic be us and list the origin length.
4305	2	A. The student data clearli show that the more you data plastic A and B the longer thei get but it is the opposit for C and D, thei onli get stronger.^p B. The student could have done 3, 4, or even 5 test someth can go wrong in 1 test, multipl test would have shown more constant results. Lastly, a materi list should have been ad to help a person prepar for the experiment.
4306	2	A-A conclus base on the student' data would be that plastic type B polym with the most stretchability.^p B-Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and/ or valid of the result would be one, chang the hang time from five minut to two or three and two, add a third trial to make result more valid.
4307	2	A- My conclus is that if the student kept on stretch thi plastic type it would probabl snapon the 3rd time. ^p B- Two wai the student could have improv thi experi is by test a third trial. Another wai is the student could have put more weight on the plastic to see how the weight affect the plastic.
4308	2	(A) Plastic type b is the most stretchabl plastic of all the bag becaus it stretch 22mm (Trial 1) & 23 (trial 2) while the other plastic didn't stretch as much. ^p (B) The student could'v improv the experiment design by state how mani weight to place on the plastic and how much each weight weighs. Also, thei could'v state how much of the plastic should be tape onto the tabl and how much should hang freely.
4309	2	a) The conclus drawn from thi student' data is that plastic B is the most stretchabl becaus it wa the on that remain firm for the longest time.^p b) Two wai the student could have improv hi procedur are, he could have specifi on how mani weight to add to the clamp and how heavi thei should be. He could also have specifi if each plastic need to be the same length.
4310	2	(a)Plast A with amount of stretch wa 10-13, and plastic C stretch wa 14-13 had the lowest stretchness. Plastic B and D with the stretch around 20-23 were the highest on with more stretchness. ^p (b) Two wai the student could improv the experiment design or valid of the result is by make more trial and make sure thei measur the same amount of stretchi correctly, to be secure.
4311	2	Add the fist two togahtr and that how I do it?
4312	2	1) Acord to the data, plastic B stretch the most, and with the exept of D, the second trial test onli differ by 1 or 2 mm, from the first test. ^p 2) To have improv the experiment, the student could have stretch the plastic longer. The second time on us heavier weight dure te second trial.
4313	2	After the experi wa over we conclud that plastic type B ha been stretch the furthest from the weight pull it down. Plastic type D wa the second most stretch plastic then after that wa plastic type C, and final plastic type A. ^p The student didn't show how long the plastic wa befor stretch it. So we didn't know if all bag were the said length to start out. Another improv could'v have been tell exactli how much weight wa ad to the end of the bags.
4314	2	To end our experi we calcul our data together. For plastic type A, for T1 we got 10 for T2 we got 12. For B we got T1 22 and T2 12. For C we got T1 14 and T2 13. Last for plastic type D T1 wa 20 and T2 20. The student could of us less weight for step 4. The student also let the clamp hang longer with 10 more minutes.
4315	2	i conclud that plastic B stretch the most. It T1 wa 22 and it T2 wa 23 A,C,D their T1 and T2 wa lower but D had 20 for T1 and T2. for valid the student could have done the weight for all the plastic togeth instead of do it separate, thei could have done three trial instead of 2 trials.
4316	2	It appear that plastic type B stretch out the most and plastic type A stretch out the least. One wai that the student could have improv their experi would be to tell what kind of plastic to do. Also the student should have put how big the plastic wa in the begining.
4317	2	A.) A conclus that can be drawn from the student data is plastic type B ha more Strechabl than the other ones. ^p Two wai a student could improv the experi design could be add more trial the minimum is three, and also make sure the plastic ar all the same size to begin with. Do thi could also increas the valid of the of the experi and make it more accurate.
4318	2	Thei could of ad more weight and thei could of let it hang for more than 5 min. The con clusion I have base on the student' data is that (T2) wa more stretch out than (T1).
4319	2	A conclus for the graph could be what thei did to get to the end of their experiment.^p B. One wai the student could improv their self is by make there product better so the number stai higher instead of alwai decreasing. Another wai is to make sure everyth is all right.
4320	2	A. The plastic polym with the most stretchabl wa plastic type B. thi is becaus it stretch 22 and 23mm. B. Two wai the student could told you what type of plastic thei were us and how much weight wa appli to stretch out the plastics.
4321	2	In the trial the plastic type B stretch the farthest so from thi least it is the strongest. b The student could have improv their experi by run 1 more trial for valid and a control to compar to.
4322	2	A) For the most part all of the plastic chang in some wai except for on type. ^p B) The student could have done the experi more then just two times, to see how his/her answer might have verifed.
4323	2	a) My conclus on thi experi is plastic type A is the stronger becaus it stretch the least.^p b) 2 wai that could of improv the experi ar make the plastic the same size and us the same amount of weights.
4324	2	a. Base on the data, I conclud that plastic type B Stretch the most dure both trials. ^p b. Two wai the student could'v improv their experi wa make the plastic all the same length befor stretch them. Also, specifi what types/s weigh becaus on person could put on a 1 pound weight and someon els could put on a 2 pound weight and get complet differ results.
4325	2	a) Base on the data type B stretch the most in both trial then ani others. Type B had more elatist and type A had the least elastisity. ^p b) Thi student could improv thi experi by record the amount it stretch everi 2 minutes. Also state whether the same plastic us in T1 is us in T2.
4326	2	Base on the student data the conclus will be that plastic B work better than the other in the first trial plastic B had 22 mm and the second trial plastic B had 23 mm.^p Two wai the student would have improv the experiment design ar to repeat the experiment. Another wai is to add a control.
4327	2	A) Plastic type B wa the stretchest plastic type becaus in trial 1 it got 22 mm and it trial 2 it got 12 mm. ^p B) The student could have had the plastic type start at the same length and could have chang the experi the which plastic is the most discrible.
4328	2	A) In conclusion, plastic type B stretch the most, end up at 22 and 23 mm, respectively.^p B) Two wai the student could'v improv the design/valid of the result is includ how much weight is put on the clamps, and also includ the origin size of plastic to begin with.
4329	2	A) The conclus I have drawn from the student data is that plastic B ha the most flexibl and plastic A ha the least.^p B) Two wai the student could have improv his/her data is by measur each plastic befor he/sh stretch it out. The also could have.
4330	2	b)The student could have improv by describ how mani weight ar us and how much thei weighed.
4331	2	I would sai that plastic tape B ha the most streachability, two wai the student could improv their design would be to have a specif amount of weight so the expiri is valid and thei could add a third trial to make the expiri more valid.
4332	2	My conclus to the experi is that the best work plastic ar A &B becaus thei stretch out the most the second time. The student could have run anoth trial and also ad more weight to make sure it would realli stretch.
4333	2	(A) Overall, plastic type B had stretch the most. Plastic type B just stretch a littl further. Thi mean that plastic type B had the most resist to the weights/clamp and thi plastic would be the most durabl to us B. One wai to improv the design would be to measur all the plastic to the same length so the result come out more accurate. Another wai could be to have weight all be the same weight so some plastic type don't have advantag over others.
4334	2	a) The conclus I drew from thi experi is that plastic D stretch the most. It stretch 20mm while plastic A onli stretch 12 mm.^p b) The student could have replac the sampl befor the second trial and made all of the sampl the same length.
4335	2	A. From the data you can conclud that the plastic type B stretch the furthest. ^p B. The the could have done more experi and thei could tell how much weight so start out with.
4336	2	The student could have averag the two length of each plastic to get onli on number for each. Thei also should have done on more trail to make it reliable.
4337	2	a.) The student' data show that plastic type B had stretch the most out of the four type of polym plastics. ^p b.) One wai the student could'v improv the design and/or valid of the result would be to make a third trial, see as some of the result were changed. Another wai would'v been to tell the reader what weight to us and to make sure to us the same ones.
4338	2	Base on the student' data T2 seem to be abl to stretch just a littl more compar to T1. Two wai to improv the experi would be of cours more trial and more valiability. The student could get differ brand of plastic from groceri store and test which is more stretchable.
4339	2	-I think that the plastic type is go to be more danger becaus the student have add clamp to the bottom of the plastic types. not onli that but what the student could have done is to make the plastic type hung for more than 5 minut and thei could ha
4340	2	Base on the experiment, plastic type B wa the stretchiest becaus it stretch the most from the weight place in it. Two wai in which the student could have improv the experi ar specifi the number weight and how much thei could weigh. If the student did not us the same amount of weight for each plastic then these plastic ar invalid.
4341	2	My conclus to the student data is that the sampl that wa us wasn't the correct form of solution, and I think if thei ad make there experi would'v been successful.
4342	2	a) I conclud that plastic B is more strechabl becaus it ha the most (higher) length which is 23 and two trials. ^p The student could have take a longer tabl and do all the plastic and attach the clamp in all of them while the on befor wa hang for 5 mins.
4343	2	Plastic type B stretch longer then all the other plastic types. B T1 wa 22 and T2 wa 23 is stretch the most weight in 5 minutes. Thei student could have improv their experi by do anoth trial like T3 and see which plastic type held the most weight.
4344	2	a.Th conclus I drew form the student' data is that the plastic type A stretch out about the same each trial except for plastic type D which stai the same ^p b. Two wai the student could have improv their experiment design or valid their result is by increas the # of weight and or time of the trials. Also, anoth wai that could have made their result more valid is by have more than just result more valid.
4345	2	2) I can conclud that plastic B stretch the most amount out of all the other plastics. ^P b) The student could improv the experiment design by ad more trial and ad a control.
4346	2	A) When we test four differ polym plastic to see which on increas in length after ad weights, the result read that plastic B increas the most by 22-23mm. The plastic that increas by 10-12mm. ^p B) One wai the student could have improv their procedur wa by specifi how much weight thei ad to the plastics. Another wai to improv valid is to add a third trial to the experiment.
4347	2	The conclus I have drawn base on the student data is that plastic B and D ar the best polym becaus those were the two plastic that had stretch the farthest on both trials. ^p Two wai the student could improv their experi would be to do even more trials. Also thei would need to make sure that the free edg hang from the plastic ar the same length each time.
4348	2	A) From the inform of the graph I can conclud that plastic type B stretch the most for both trial the amount stretch wa the highest. ^p 3b) Wai those student could improv there expirement, is by be more detail in those procedure. Another wai would be to perform more trial and even have anoth group recreat the experi and compar notes.
4349	2	Plastic B is the strongest with the length of 23. One why the student could improv their result is how much the weight weigh. Another wai is how heavi wa the clamp.
4350	2	In conclus base on the student' data, plastic type D had the same amount stretch 20mm. However, Plastic type A had 10mm the first trial and it stretch more to 12 on the second trial. Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by write the type of plastic instead of type A,B,C and D. Another wai the student could have improv is by ad a predict to what thei thought wa go to happen.
4351	2	Accord to the chart Trial 1 wa more effect than trial 2. The student couldv improven the experimet by us differ materi than plastic. Or do at least on more trial. (T3)
4352	2	I conclud that plastic type B is the most stretchable, follow by type D, follow by type C, follow by type C, follow by type A. One wai the experi could be improv is by list the starting/end length of the strip and to make sure all of the plastic start at the same size. Another wai to improv is to perform more than 2 trials.
4353	2	a. Plastic type A is the most stretchabl and type d is not stretchabl at all. ^p b. That student could of done more trial of each plastic type and done a control of each.
4354	2	Base on the data plastic type B can be stretch more than the other plastics.^p 1. Thei could have said the type of plastic used. 2. Thei could have ad the averag stretch.
4355	2	"Base upon the student' inform "" by perform thi experiment, plastic type B ha stretch the most on averag by 22.5 millimeters. Plastic type D come in 2nd with 20 mm. Type C in 3rd with 13.5 and type A in just with 11. ^p Two wai that the student could have improv hi experi is by first allow a length everi plane of tape should be befor starting. The student could also provid a number of weight or amount of weight appli to ar place of type, all of which should have the same amount."
4356	2	a) The conclus base from the student data would be the more weight ad to the plastic type the more like it would be for the plastic to stretch. ^p b) The student could improv the experi design by ad specif how much the weight weigh. Another improv would be to do more trials.
4357	2	Base on the data found by the student in the polym investig plastic B had the most tensil strength or could stretch the most tensil plastic A had the least tensil strength. ^p The student could have improv the experi by perform 3 or more trial for validity. Also the student could have includ the weight of each weight that wa stretch the plastic.
4358	2	a) My conclus is that plastic type B stretch the farthest and plastic type A is thicker becaus it didn't stretch as much.^p B) The student should have onli did 3 trial and thei should have told us what kind of plastic wa us for the experiment.
4359	2	3. a) Accord to the results, plastic type A is the strongest becaus it stretch the least (in mm is the first trial and 12 mm in the second ). Plastic type B is the weakest out of the four becaus it stretch the most(22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second). b) These ar wai the student could have made their experi better.1) Take all plastic sampl with the same length. 2) Add weight into the clamp until the plastic stretch out to it full potenti rather than ilet it hang for five minutes. 3) Do a third trial.
4360	2	In conclusion, the plastic were expiri and plastic that had the potenti to strech most wa plastic B which result were 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. The on that least stretch wa plastic A with 10mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. All the other plastic result that were test were in between.
4361	2	It seem as if the plastic stretch further or stai the same in these trials. Type A stretch from 10mm to 12mm. Type B 22mm to 23mm. Type C 14mm to 13mm, and type D 20mm to 20mm. ^p B) The student should have been more specif with their table. the student also could have state hi valid better in or while do hi experiment.
4362	2	a) Accord to the data it can be infer that plastic B' polym plastic stretch the most compar to the other plastics. It can also be conclud that the data is preas due to the close of the number from the 1st trial to the 2nd trial.^P b.) The student could improv the experimeat by have the amount of plastic us a constant. Thi allow the student to have onli on independ variable. (The type of plastic). Thei can also explain that the weight most be the same weight for plastic, so the data is not effected.
4363	2	a) B stretch out the most becaus it stretch out, a total of 45(mm) A 22, C27 and D 40. B) One wai to improv the lab is instead of two trial do three. Find waai is have a control grone.
4364	2	Two wai that the student could have improv hi experi is by ad materi and also do the experi again.
4365	2	A) I can conclud that the plastic type B stretch the most. It stretch 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial.^p B) One wai thi experi could be improv is by ad more trials. Another wai that thi experi could,bi improv is by tell or start how long wa each plastic type befor stretch it.
4366	2	A. Base off of the data tabl plastic B had the greatest stretch with 23mm while plastic A had the least with 10mm estretch.^p B Two wai the student could have improv the experi wa to have more trial and also have a control
4367	2	a)Polym B ha the most stretchability, whilepolym A ha the least stretchability.^p (b)The student should have includ the measur of the initi and final length the plastic samples. Thei also should'v record the amount of weight thei used.
4368	2	Base on the student data I conclud that Plastic type B wa most stretchabl and A wa the least stretchy. To improv the valid at thi experi thei could have includ the start length, how much the weight weigh ad also could of condict a third or more trials.
4369	2	The student show that some plastic could be stretch by weights.
4370	2	a) One conclus that I determin accord to the data wa that plastic type B stretch the most overal in both trial 1 and 2. Another conclus on could draw is that when conduct the experi on plastic type D, it wa probabl the most reliabl and had mani controls, becaus the amount stretch (mm) stai exactli the same. ^p b) One wai the student have improv the experi design wa by measur the same side of bag for A,B,C,D( in# 1) Another could be to add equal weight (#4) to each type of bag.
4371	2	Base on the student data the polym plastic all had had differ weight becaus all stretch out differently. To better the experi the lab need to includ the stretch measur so there can be data to compar befor & after. Another thing would to for all plastic is store on the same length. Thi data is neccari to make just number on a graph to data.
4372	2	In T1 and T2 B stretch out the most dur the 5 minutes.^p The student could improv hi experi by do an extra trial for a more valid result. As well the student could have state in the experiment design the weight heavieness.
4373	2	A) Base on the the data given to us in the answer banklet plastic type B stretch out the most compar to all the other plastic type in both trials. ^p B) The student could have improv the experi by ad more trial which would of made the experi more accur anoth wai would be specifi how much the weight and clamp actual weighed.
4374	2	A) Plastic type B 's polym ha the most stretchabl as shown in both trial and the polym type in B is similar to the polym in D due to the fact that their result ar closest. Polym in A is not veri strecher nor is the on in C. ^P B) Wai to improv both the design and valid includ us someth strongest than tape to hold up the plastic and weight, also us a timer to improv valibility.
4375	2	A) Accord to the result of the student plastic B wa stretch out the most. For plastic A the result ar 10 mm for T1 and 12 mm for T2. For plastic B the result ar 22 mm for T1 and 23 for T2. Plastic C the result ar 14 mm for T1 and 13 mm for T2. Lastli for plastic D the result ar 20 mm for T1 and 20 mm for T2. B) One wai the student could have improv their experi wa thei could have done more trial with the differ type of plastic. Another wai thei could have improv wa to show how mani weight thei us and what kind of plastic thei us so we could see the effect thei had accord to the type.
4376	2	a. The student bottl have stretch more dure wa first atempt and plastic B wa stretch the most dure both.^p b. The student could have improv hi experi by us 2 bottl to tape and not dorp the other two bottles.
4377	2	two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is thei could of did a littl more and took there time to make thing good and do there best.
4378	2	Upon the complet of the experiment, it wa conclud that plastic type B stretch the most. Plastic B stretch on aver ag 22 mm, while Plastic A stretch an averag 11mm, plastic C stretch an averag 13.5 mm, and plastic D stretch an averag 20mm. Two wai that the group could have improv their experi would be to includ how big the clamp is and to includ how much weight is be ad to the clamp.
4379	2	Base on the student data i have come to the conclus that plastic D is the most reliabl polym becaus it stretch the most. By give the measur of plastic us for each trial the student could have improv the experi design. Also, by write the amount of weight thei use, the student could have improv hi experi design.
4380	2	A) Base on the student' data, plastic B is the most stretchy. ^p B) Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be to state how much weight to add to the clamp, and to do 3 trial with an averag instead of just two with no average.
4381	2	A.) Plastic a and b stretch more from trail on to to trail 2. (Plastic C went down on and D stai the same. B.) Two wai the student could have, improv the experiment design or valid of the result is thei could have have done anoth trail for each plastic. Also thei could have made sure all of the plastic were the same length to start off with.
4382	2	Base on the student trials, plastic type B wa the best on becaus it allow the most stretching. In it first test it score the highest of 22mm, and then in test 2 score 23 mm, also the highest. Plastic type B will stretch the most if weight wa put on it and for 5 minutes. 6P (A) The student could have improv thi lab by ad specif measur to certain step such as how much weight should be ad in step 4. (B) The student could have also improv rethi lab by make each plastic the same length. In step 1 to just said to measur it, not to cut it to a certain length. If you make each on the same length the result will all be accurate.
4383	2	Plastic type A stretch longer the second that, so did plastic type B. Plastic type D stretch the same both trials. The student could of name the type of plastic or test it more than two times.
4384	2	A) The stretchabl for the four differ type of polym plastics. The calcul for trial on and trial two we almost the same. For exampl plastic type A on trial on it wa 10 and trial 2 it wa 12 then on plastic type D for both trial it wa 20. ^p The two wai thei could have improv it wa by put weight in and make it heavier and the other on is you can also bring the plastic bag apart try to rip them.
4385	2	The conclus in thi experi is that plastic type B is the most stretchability. When the student ad the weight to the plastic and it stretch out to do the longest in both trials. Trial 1 it wa 22mm and in trial 2 it wa 23mm. 2 wa that the student would of improv thi experi is to perform more trial to receiv the most accur answer, and thei could of had control and see how the plastic stretch with no weight on them.
4386	2	Base on the student data, Plastic Type B stretch the most. In the first trial it stretch 22 mm and in the second trail it stretch 23 mm. The second most trial pliabl materi stretch 20 mm. The student could have improv the design by us sampl that were exactli the same length. Also, he/sh could have state how much weight thei were us to stretch the material.
4387	2	Base on the data I can conclud thei plastic B and D ar the most flexible, to improv the experi student could have cut all the sampl to the same length and thei could have preform more trials.
4388	2	"A)Plastic type B had the best stretchabl while A had the worst. Type B stretch an averag of 7.3 unit longer in T1 And 8 unit in T3.^p (B)In their procedur thei could'v put measur unit (be ""inches, millimeters, etc) that thei used. thei could'v specifi the amount of weight thei were us in step #4."
4389	2	Accord to thi student' data, plastic type B is the most stretchabl of the type tried. Both trial you did and start do'n sai that it wa stretch further than the other 3 samples, which the data keep accur valid. The experi design wa poor. One wai thi student could have improv their design is to have been more specif in measurements, the size of the plastic samples, how much hangs, ar the tight, etc. Another wai to improv the valid of their result is to perform more than just 2 trials.
4390	2	The data that the student got is corrupted. The reason I sai thi is becaus he/sh should have wrote on the data tabl the start measur of each bag. He/sh could have also us the same amount of weight written it on the procedur to get more accur results. Another wai that the student could have improv would be do anoth trial to make that the result ar accurate.
4391	2	In conclus to the data gather by the student I have come to the conclus that the polym plastic type A ha strech the least therefor make it the most stable. And that polym plastic type B wa the least to strech the most therefor be the least stable. The student could have increas the valid of there result by ad more variabl such as amount of weight applies. As well as ad even more trials.
4392	2	a) It can be conclud that plastic type B stretch the most, and plastic type A, the least. ^p b) The student could have improv the experi by us plastic that were all the same length and mass. For example, if B wa a sampl of plastic 1100 decametr long, of cours it would stretch farther than the rest. Also, anoth problem go off of that is that the mass of the weight should remain consistent. Secondly, to make elast certain more trial from differ student should be done, to make sure that the result ar valid.
4393	2	A) Accord to the data tabl test the stretchabl on 4 differ polym plastics, plastic B is the stretchiest becaus it stretch 22-23mm. The other type of plastic didn't stretch thi much. ^P B) One wai thi experiment design could be improv is to sai the 4 differ kind of plastic used. Another wai thi can be improv is to tell us how much weight to add to the clamp when stretch the plastic.
4394	2	To inquir hi experi be could of said how much weight he ad the the plastic bags. Each on wa to have the same amount of weight. Second he should or had same type of measur ment on how long the bag where befor he did the experiment, then show how long thei got.
4395	2	A) Base on the student data I can conclud that plastic is work the best for both trial with 22 mm for that I and 23mm for trial 2. Plastic D not 20mm for both trials. Plastic C with 14mm and 13mm and the least stretchi wa plastic A with 10mm and 12mm. B) Two wai thei could have improv wa to name the polym such as BP. Thei also could have said how much the clamp and the weight weighed.
4396	2	a) Polym C appear to have the greatest amount of streach ability. ^p b) The student could have ad a control and perform more trials.
4397	2	(A) The student found the two stretch plastic to be B and D. Thei both have over 20 mm in both trial and perform much better than the two other trials. ^p (B) The student could have improv hi procedur of experi by give a hypothesi of just which plastic thei thought would be the stretchiest. After that thei need as if there hypothesi wa correct and if not explain why it wasn't.
4398	2	a) A conclus base on the student' data would be that plastic type A would be the stretchiest plastic becaus it stretch the most at two mm, while type B and C stretch on mm, and type D didn't stretch at all.^p b.) Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be to record the measur of plastic befor stretch on the data table, and also to add more trials.
4399	2	Plastic B is the most stretchy. ^p The student should have made sure all of the plastic were the same length befor preform the experiment. If all the plastic ar differ length we have no wai of know if thei stretch becaus of the length or becaus of the type of plastic. He or she should also have indic the weight attach to the clamp. Otherwis the experi cannot be repeat but repetit is an essenti part of validity.
4400	2	(a) Plastic B stretch the longest in trial 2 23 mm and plastic D be the second longest and A have the shortest amount stretched. ^p (B) The student could have had the clamp hang a longer time rather than just 5 minut and thei could of had a third trial becaus some plastic stretch longer the second time round.
4401	2	Base on the student data there realli wasnt ani differ in the anim stretched. The student could have put more weight on thei even could have extend the time hang to improv the experi design and / or valid of the results.
4402	2	A conclus can be that plastic type B and D ar more strecthabl than plastic type A and C. One wai thei could have improv is by ad the plastics' origin length in the graph to help show that thei did strecth. Another wai is to have includ the weight of the weight so that it can be duplic if needed.
4403	2	A. Plastic A stretch 2mm, plastic B stretch 1mm, plastic C stretch 1mm and plastic D didn't stretch. ^p B. The student could have done thi over distinct result . The student could have also check hi work more frequent to see exactli how long it took for each of the piec of plastic to lower.
4404	2	a. As you can see, plastic B could stretch longer than ani plastic. Plastic D had similar result for both trials. Plastic A wa the onli plastic that wa abl to not stretch that far.^p b. What thi student should do to improv hi experi is to run more trial and to add what he is compar to.
4405	2	Base on the inform provid from the experiment, I conclud that plastic B ha the most stretchabl (22mm, 23m) and plastic A is the least stretchabl (10mm, 12mm). Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and valid of their lab wa to cut the same length of each plastic prior to test stretchabl and to specifi the amount and mass at the weight to added.
4406	2	My conclus is that the plastic that can stretch more is plastic B becaus it ha the longest account stretch in mm, and other plastic do not stretch longer than plastic B.^p Two wai the student could have improv is by put on set of weight in T1 and anoth st of weight in T2. Also thei could have improv by let it hang for more time to see if thei can resist.
4407	2	a) From thi data, it can be conclud that plastic B is the most flexibl and plastic A is the least. ^p b) The student need to perform at least 3 trial with each plastic for it to be valid also, the student set a length at which plastic should initi be. Thi will improv valid as well.
4408	2	My conclus is that the type of plastic similar to strength becaus none of them had a huge difference, but type B and D ar closer to farthest on is 23, the other 22 is now A and C ar closer on is 12 the other 13. And type D stai the same dure both trials. Plu a wai to improv thi experi would be have more trial becaus there wasn't that mani data to compar and the on thei had wasn't relli of a difference.
4409	2	a) Base on the student data plastic type B strech the most out of ani other type of plastic. b) To improv the experi the student could have increas the amount of time thei would allow the piec to strech further and anoth plastic could end up strech further, all the plastic mai have need wa more time. To improv the valid of the result the student should have includ the plastic orgin length in the table.
4410	2	a) As you gui can see the sampl of plastic B wa the most strechabl plastic out of all of them, the plastic B strech the most in both trials.^p b) 1 wai that the student could of chang the experi by label the plastic that he used. 2 He also could of chang the weight of the clamp.3) He could of also ad anoth try to make sure that witch is the most strechabl plastic.
4411	2	Base upon the data plastic type B, stretch the most. The student could have had a design amount of weight for ad to the clamps. The student also should have put step 7 befor step 6 to make, thing go along more smoothly.
4412	2	A) a conclus of thi experi is type B stretch the most, it Stretch an averag of 22.5mm, thi wa greater then type D with an Averag of 20mmtpe C with 13.5mm and lastli A with 11mm. ^p B) Two wai the student could have improv their experi design/valid is specifi if the same amount of weight is be ad and have 3trial to make sure number ar accurate.
4413	2	Plastic type B held 22mm on the first trial and 23mm on the second trial. So plastic type B held the most mm in both trials. The onli plastic close to it wa plastic type D which had 20mm in trail 1 and 20mm in trial 2. Sinc plastic type B held B held more in both trials, then plastic type B is the can hold the most. The wai the student could have improv their experi is by have more trials. Thi would have improv the valid of their results. Another wai is by make it longer than 5 minut to let the plastic hang, becaus it might leav longer stretch much.
4414	2	A) It seem like plastic B ha the most stretch abil becaus it stretch 22 mm in T1 and 23 T2. ^p B) To improv the experiment assign the student could have kept the amount of weight thei carri to the bag constant and thei could have kept the weight for anoth five minut and measur it again afterwards.
4415	2	In the second trail two plastics, A and B, stretch out more unlik 2 and B, C stretch less the second time while D stai the same. One wai the student could have improv hi experi is by do it a third time to see which of the highest two were right. A second would be show the length of the plastic when the student first started.
4416	2	A) A conclus base on the student data is that plastic type A is the strongest becaus T1 onli stretch 10mm and T2 onli stretch 12mm. ^p B) Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by name the type of plastic that a us and by ad a control to the experiment design.
4417	2	A) A conclus that can be drawn from thi experi is that A wa the weakest and C wa the most ourabl ar ^p B) on wagt that it can be improv is to explain how C wa unstretched. Another wai for improv wa have more trial to see what happen to each of the plastics.
4418	2	A) My conclus for thi experi is that Trial 2 is go to get the most stretchabl for the plastic type. ^p B) The plastic sampl doesn't have to hang freeli down the side of a tabl and befor you perform the second trial just like the first, add on addit 5-10 minut to the procedure.
4419	2	In thi expier we have learn that all bag tend to stretch when carri weights. In thi expierement, plastic type A prove to be the least stretchiest while plastic type prove to be stretch the most. ^P The student could have said how mani weight to be add or how heavi thei total up to be. ^P The student could have also said what type of plastic thei us so we can test it our selves.
4420	2	Base on the student data the conclus that plastic B ha the most stretchabl becaus it ha the highest length in millimet after the experiment. Two thing the student could have done to improv the experiment design and valid of the result would be hold the variabl more controll. For exampl set the length of each plastic next if thei had a set amount of weight, the result would have come out more valid.
4421	2	The student had 4 type of plastic A, B, C, D. Thei want to see which on would stretch the most. Thei held 2 trial and B came out to be the stretch ist out of them all with a 22, 23 mm
4422	2	Base off of the data, plastic type D had the longest stretchabl while plastic type A had the least. Two wai the student could have improv their experi would be better perform more trials, or make sure that the weight appli to each plastic wa the same.
4423	2	A - In the second trial plastic type A and B both had more mm but plastic type C in the first trial there wa more and with plastic type D it wa the same for both trials.B-Thei could repeat trials, and us more differ type of plastics.
4424	2	a.) The order of plastics, from most to least stretchy, is B, D, C then A, where A is the stretchiest and B the least. The overal stretch of the plastic remain mostli the same from T2 to T2. ^p b.) Tape the plastic a specif distanc in from the tabl edg and ad ident and specifi amount of weight to each plastic would improv the validity, especi when work with such small length chances.
4425	2	a) Base on the student data the plastic don't stretch a lot much type 1 and type 2 ar almost the same and dont have a much difference.^p b)
4426	2	A) Base on the data, plastic B stretch the most out of the four plastics. ^p B) One wai to improv the experi is to specifi how much the weight weigh (4). Another wai is to set a specif length pf plastic, not just ani measur the length (1).
4427	2	A. Base on the resluts, plastic type b wa the best with the longest (mm) stretch in both trials, 22,23. Then type d with 20mm in both trial then c with 14mm, 13mm. Final type A with 10mm, 12mm. ^p B. Two wai that the student could improv their valid ar 1. do more trial and 2. us more type of plastics.
4428	2	a.) Base on the student data from thi experiment, plastic type B had the greatest stretchabl out of all four plastics. ^p To be more accur with the valid of their result would be to make sure the length of all the sampl in both trial were equal for all types. Another wai to improv i he experi would be to increas the weight in the second trial by doubl them, and then sampl the data from the two trials.
4429	2	a) Plastic B can stretch the longest where as Plastic A can not stretch as far. ^p b) One wai to improv the experi would be to specifi a specif number and type of weight that ar be ad and to keep it constant. Also, anoth few trial would prove it valid becaus there could be human errors, and more trial would lead to more accur data.
4430	2	Base on the experiment, the best plastic base on stretchabl would be plastic B. It stretch 22 and 23 mm, which is the most out of all the plastics. Plastic D would also be good, stretch 20 mm, plastic A and C were not so good stretch 10, 12 and it 13 respectively. One wai the student could improv their experi is to add a third trial (B). Thi would allow for better result becaus it experi is be done 3 trial and an averag could be made. Another improv would be to add differ weight to see how far each plastic will stretch.
4431	2	1) The most stretchabl plastic with the most tensil strength, is plastic D, becaus dure both trial it stretch further than all the other plastics.^p 2) a) Thei could have formul a hypothesi so that their experi would have becom more guided.b)Thei could have made sure that each plastic (befor stretching) wa the same length.
4432	2	A) Base on the student data, my conclus to thi is that plastic type D would be the most stretchable, becaus for both trials, the mm of the length wa still the same. ^p B) Two wai the student could have improv the experi wa by tell the differ of the two trials, and also did a differ polym plastic have an effect on how it would stretch.
4433	2	a) Thi experi on polym turn out to work perfectli without ani weird results. For exampl in thi experi plastic/ polym B perform the best becaus in trial on it stretch about 22mm and in trial two it increas flexibl by stretch 23mm. While on the other hand plastic /polym A experi the worst becaus in trial on it onli stretch about 4mm and in trial two it onli increas it flexibl to 12mm. ^p B)Two wai that those student could have improv thi experi is by name the plastic in which thei test and also thei should have measur how heavi the weight ar to get a more set on judgement , more trials, more attempt & more accur results.
4434	2	Base on the data plastic A had the most signific growth in Amount strech with strech 2 mm faster than it' origin trial therefor thi polym ha the most streachability. ^p The student could of had an control, also same amount of weights, and did more trials.
4435	2	The conclus base on the student' data is that plastic type B is abl to stretch the farthest with 22m in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Two wai the student could have improv the experi would to make sure that the amount of tape thei put on the plastic wa equal and how far thei tape the plastic on the table.
4436	2	The student could have improv the experi design and valid of the results. Thei could have done so, by give a measur of how far the plastic will hang off from the table. Have the plasic at differ length hang from the tabl will caus error. Also she could sai how heavi of weight will be hanging, and for how long. All of these factor affect the experiment.
4437	2	Thi experi conclud that plastic type A is the least stretchabl land plastic type B the most stretchable. Plastic C is also not that stretchabl and D is stretchable. One wai to add valid to the result is to make sure all of the weight ar the same weight. Also that the origin plastic ar all the same length.
4438	2	My conclus is that plastic type B wa the plastic that strech the most. Also in trial two (T2) all the plastic strech more except for plastic type C. The student could have improv by make hi hypothesi clearer. He also could of given us the name of the plastics.
4439	2	Plastic type B wa stretch out the most. The student could have improv the experiment design by calcul the two trial and make the total amount the plastic were stretched. Thei also could have put down the length of the plastic befor thei start streching.
4440	2	Base on the student' data, plastic type B stretch the most out of all the polym plastic. The student could have improv the experi by test more specif in their procedure. The length of the tape should be the same for all the plastic as it wa not mentioned. The weight of the weight wa not given as it doe affect the result in the amount stretched. The student could have also mention the name of the polym to make the data tabl more specif and the experi more us to others.
4441	2	a. Plastic type B stretch the farthest . Even though A C and D did not have veri differ results, B stretch the most. Also plastic D remain constant both trials. ^p B) One wai the student could have improv wa to make more trials. Two trial can not give the best results. Also, thei could have lengthen the time and put heavier weight on the clamps.
4442	2	A) The result that were given show that type A wa the least stretchiest type C had the second least stretch, type D wa the second stretchiest and final type D could stretch the most. ^p The student could have improv thi experi is by show how long thei stretch the plastic till it broke, and add a control to the experi so thei could compar the result to a regular stretch plastic.
4443	2	A) The conclus of thi experi is that polym B ha the most stretchability, while polym A is the least stretchable. ^p B) The student could have improv there experi version by state the amount of weight us to stretch each polym so if further studi is need the experi can be replic and to add more trial to confirm the data.
4444	2	a) Plastic B ha the greakest amant of stretchability, surpass the next stretchiest by 2-3 mm. ^p b) The students, in order to improv validity, must record the length of each sampl prior to stretching, to observ change. Also, thei should acknowledg the amount of weight us to stretch the plastics, and never chang it.
4445	2	"a) The conclus I'd draw from the student' data would be that plastic type ""B"" wa the stretchiest. ^p b) To improv hi experiment design, the student could'v specifi how heavi the weight could be so that anyon replic hi work would know. To improv hi result validity, he could have done more than 2 trials-th more trial he did, the more valid hi result would be."
4446	2	(a) Plastic type A stretch the least and is therefor the most durabl of the 4 types. ^p (b) The student could improv the experiment design by determin a consist start area for all of plastics, and thei could improv the valid by do more trials.
4447	2	Thi student' data prove that plastic D had the greatest stretchability. stretching, 20 mm after 5 minutes. The least stretchabl type of plastic wa plastic A which onli stretch 10mm in the first trial and 12 mm in the second. A wai the student could have improv the experi is thei should have us a more firm materi than tape such as stabl or tie it. Another wai to improv is to allow the trial to each stand for 10 minut to receiv greater results.
4448	2	My conclus to thi polym investig is that plastic type B ha the most stretchability. I think thi becaus trial 1 and trial 2 both have the most stretchability. Some wai that the experi could have been improv is by take the I cader how much. The weight and clamp weighed. Another wai the the experi could he improv is by tell the reader where the clamp wa placed.
4449	2	a) Plastic B wa the stretch of all the polymeres. Plastic A wa the strongest of all the polymers. ^P b) Thi person should have the exact length of the plastic. He/sh also should have told the exact amount of weight to add to the clamp.
4450	2	To my conclus it look like on second trial almost everi plastic type stretch more than the first time becaus it wa alreadi streten from the first trial also think the thanken and the plastic the less it stretened. two wai to improv the experi is time it longer to see the differ and us a differ piec of plast for each trial.
4451	2	In conclus plastic type B stretch out the longest in both trial and most of the other were far behind it. Two wai I would improv the design is to sai how much weight I am ad at a time and attach two clamp on the bottom to even out the weight so it didn't rip through the middle.
4452	2	A) All plastic stretch but D make D the most durabl plastic. ^p B). Add more trial which would improv the data. ^p Instead of the weight be on for 5 minut have them on for 10 would show long term effect. ^p us the same clamp for for all plastics.
4453	2	Thei could have us beacher holder and tape the plastic to the beaker holder and let it hold freely.Thei could get more result for differ trials.
4454	2	The data shave that plastic A stretch the most compar to the other plastics. Plastic A stretch 2mm, plastic B stretch 1mm, plastic C decreas 1mm in trial 2 and plastic D stai the same. Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design/valid of the result is to includ the start length of each plastic in the result to better understand how much each plastic stretched. Secondli for trial 2 I think the student should have ad more weight and ad a trial 3 with more weight for more results.
4455	2	Base on the student' data I can see that plastic type B had the Most stretchabl becaus both trial it stretch the most. To make thi more valid, the student should have us the same length to start with for each plastic. Also thei should includ how mani weight should be ad and have much each weight weigh in order to keep it constant.
4456	2	A) Plastic type B will Sstrech the most, while plastic A will strech the least. B) describ the initi lenht of each plastic, and describ the amount of weight ad to the clamp.
4457	2	A conclus that can be drawn from their data is that plastic type B ha the most elast compar to A,C, and D. Two wai the student could have improv the experi and made it more valid would be to do anoth trial and let us know where each of the plastic start length were.
4458	2	Plastic A and B stretched, cup C Di stretch whe mm and plastic D stai the same. Thi experi could be just prove by us be4tter plastic or live the weight in longer.
4459	2	3.a) Thei found that plastic type B ha the exact stretchabl becaus it stretch more than ani of the other polymers. ^p b) The could improv the valid of the experi by do more trials. Thei could includ the size and wight of the wight which would in tu a improv the design or the experiment.
4460	2	a) Plastic B stretch the most at av averag at 22.5 mm plastic A onli stretch an averag of 11mm, which is the least out of all of the plastic tested. b) One wai the student could have improv their experi would be to sai how much weight thei ar pour onto the clamp. Another thing thei should have done would be to beep all of the plastic tape to a tabl at the same height. It doe not sai thei ar all held at the same height in the procedure, so we cannot assum thei were.
4461	2	Base on the student' data, plastic type B is the most stretchy, and type A doesn't stretch as far. ^P 2 wai the student could have improv wa do a 3rd trial for more compar results. Another wai would be have the same amount of weight for each type.
4462	2	a) A conclus that can be drawn base on the student data is that the plastic A stretch less in each trial from ani other plastic T. it wa 10 and T2 it wa 12mm. ^p B) Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by first tell us how mani weight C how heavi thei should be. The second wai is by do more trials.
4463	2	In conclusion, each on of the plastic ar differ type of plastic due to the understand of the chart which clearli prove that each plastic is differ due to the differ amount and length thei were stretched. The student could have improv the experi by ad more test trial to see if the data is perfectli correct and by make sure the amount of weight ad on the clap were equal.
4464	2	The exampl came out pretti accur to the chart and procedure. ^p But thei need to improv possibl by do longer trial or ad how much weight if someon gave me thi procedur I would not be abl to perform it.
4465	2	A conclus that can be drawn from the student data is that the plastic that can be stretch the most is type B, and the on which can be stretch the least is type A. The student could have improv thi design by keep or consist sampl size. Another wai thi experi could have been more valid as if the weight on the plastic were also kept consistent.
4466	2	A) Base on the data we found is that plastic B wa the plastic that had stretch the most and plastic A stretch the least. ^p B) One wai the student could have improv there experiment design is to be more exact on the amount of weight used, Alsocould of shortend the time.
4467	2	As a result of our test type b stretch the most out of all the other plastic type. ^p One wai the stretch could have improv there test could be to.
4468	2	(A) A conclus cannot be made with the amount of data given, the experi doesn't show the start size of each plastic same so the data given doesn't show how much each some stretched. (B) To improv thi experi the student must record, and keep constant the size of each plastic sample. Another wai to improv the valid of thi experi is to record, and keep constant the amount of weight ad to each of the plastic samples.
4469	2	a) As you can see in my tabl that plastic B wa the most stretch plastic and the none least stretch wa plastic A.^p B) I think the student could of told how much each weight realli whey. Another thing wa how far could each plastic go and how much space wa the weight and plastic from each other.
4470	2	One wai thei could of improv thi experiment.
4471	2	My conclus is in the second trial (T2). Each plastic sampl stretch longer than it did in the first trial (T1). Two wai the student could have improv the experi is thei should have told us how each longnt pound' did the nitach anlo the clamp instead of take on sampl of plastic take 3 or 4 samples.
4472	2	Base on the student data I can conclud that plastic A and B ar both equal stretchy. Thei both increas by on mm long. I can also conclud that plastic D is not stretchi becaus through out both trail it stai at 20mm. One wai the student could have improv the experi would be to make all the plastic the same length at the beggin so the result ar more valid and clear. Thei also could have been specif about how much weight to be added. Another thing thei could add is a control
4473	2	The conclus of thi evestig is that the plastic type did not stretch much. Type D didn't even phase B. The kould have told us what kind of plastic did thei use. And what ar you us to measur the plastic types?
4474	2	a)Accord to the data, plastic type D is the strongest becaus it stretch 20 mm in both trials. Therefore, it ha the greatest stretchability.^p (b)The experi could have been improv by ensur that all the plastic on be clamp with the same amount of weights. It would also be a good idea to us a control, without the us of weights. Thi way, it would be easier to improv the end result with the control and variable.
4475	2	The polym plastic all had differ result after each trial wa tested. Plastic type A and B both had an increas in length after trial 2. Plastic type C had a neg effect by go down a mm, and D stai the same. The student could have us differ time periods, or even test the durabl of the plastic after it wa tested.
4476	2	Plastic type B stretch the farthest.^p The student could have improv the experiment design by record the exact weight to clamp. Thei also could have put the measur of the plastic befor it wa stretched.
4477	2	The conclus I can draw from the data is plastic B is the most stretchabety. The data show in trial on it stretch to 22mm and trial two it stretch 23mm while D onli stretch 20mm. ^p Two wai the student could improv the experi is do more trial and tell us how much weight to put on.
4478	2	The student got differ results. He got A-B lower higher and C-D higher lower. ^p Two wai he could have improv hi experiment design wa by do it over.
4479	2	None of the plastic realli seem to move that well mayb except millimet which in all realiti isnt much.
4480	2	a.) I conclud that plastic type B ha the most abil to stretch becaus it stretch the most in both of the trials. ^p b) Two wai the student could have improv on the experi design and valid and to us a control and add more trials.
4481	2	A. The most stretchabl plastic would be plastic type B. ^P B. First off the student have to make sure the plastic ar all the same length to begin with. Second their data tabl should'v shown what thei start out with.
4482	2	a) Plastic type B stretch the most then type D, then type c, and type A strech the least. ^p b) One wai thei could have improv would be make the weight constant. The result would also be more valid if it wa done a 3rd time.
4483	2	Plastic type B stretch the most and type A stretch the least. I can conclud that plastic type B is the most stretchy. Becaus of the lack of inform it is hard to to conclud anything. Two wai thei could have improv would be to specifi how long each plastic start, as and what your measuring, how much it stretch or how long it is total after be stretched.
4484	2	In conclus all the plastic bear up at on except plastic type D that stope the same length. Thei would of told the type of plastic thei were us becaus most plastic react differ with clamp or weigh on. Also, give befor descript on procedures.
4485	2	Plastic type 'A' and 'B' stretch more in the second trial as compar to 'C' which decreas by 1mm and 'D' which stai the same. ^p (B) Mayb to show some differ the student could have us differ weights, or the same weight but left if on for differ times.
4486	2	I think the student the student should draw a conclus base on the data he/sh has.
4487	2	Plastic type D stretch the furthest and plastic type A stretch the lowest. The student could'v list the diffrent type of plastic us and explain the procedur better.
4488	2	A) The plastic type D ha the most resist out of the group and type A ha the least amount. ^p B) The student should'v measur befor stretch is to make, control. Then the student should'v done the least on more trial.
4489	2	(A) Plastic type B stretch longer than type A, C, and D plastics. ^p (B) Two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is to add make we4ight to the second trial and have tie plastic hang longer.
4490	2	From the student data, you can conclud that plastic type A the most stretchable. You can conclud thi becaus all other type had either1 mm length change, or no chang but type A had a chang of 2 mm . Two wai the student could have improv would have been to have more trial for each type to make sure find were acurate, and to sai the amount of weight ad onto the plastic sampl in hi procedure.
4491	2	The conclus that I drew wa that plastic type B stretch the furthest, Two wai that the student could of improv there experi is that thei could of did the experi a third time, or probali let the weight hang on the plastic for more than 5 minutes.
6809	3	As describ in the article, panda eat an abund of bamboo and therefor ar specialist to China, while the koala ''eat eucalyptu leav almost exclusively.'' Both these anim ar specialist to on habitat while the python, a generalist is abl to live in a wider rang of habitat virtual anywhere.
6810	3	Panda & koala ar both specialists. In the articl it sai that thei both depend om on food source. Thei ar both differ from the python in that the python is a generalist and can eat almost anyth to stai alive.
6811	3	A specialist is China panda which eat almost noth but bamboo, or Australia' Koala bear, which eat eucalyptu leav almost exclusively.
6812	3	Panda and koala ar similar becaus thei both need a certain food that thei eat such as bamboo and eucalyptu leav but a python will not eat anyth but it need in certain climat to be abl to live there.
6813	3	Panda in China and Koala in Australia eat onli bamboo and eucalyptu leav almost exclus accord to the author. For thi reason, thei ar both specialists. Howev a the articl state a python is a generalist and abl to inhabit a number of differ locat around the world, unlik the Panda and Koala who ar limit to their nativ countries.
6814	3	Panda ar similar to koala becaus thei ar both specialists, that must have special surround and certain thing to eat. Panda and koala ar differ from python becaus a python can live almost anywher with the help of the climat generalist which is a human be as state in paragraph 20 (Achenbach,5).
6815	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei both requir specif plant for survival. Panda need bamboo, and koala need eucalyptu leaves. Both anim ar specialist ( Achenbach par 21). Thei ar both differ from python becaus python ar generalists, and thei tend to do the best in and around human (par. 20).
6816	3	Panda onli eat bamboo and koala onli eat eucalyptu leaves. Thi anim ar specialist. Python ar generalist thei can surviv on almost ani thing.
6817	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei both eat on main food sourc ( panda bamboo koala eucalyptu leav ). So thei surviv best in on stabl , non chang environment. However, python can live and adapt to new conditions, so thei can move to differ environments, such as Asia to Florida.
6818	3	Panda in China almost exclus eat bamboo make them a specialist species. Koala in Australia ar also specialist becaus thei almost exclus eat eucalyptu leaves. Thei ar diffrent from python becaus python can live almost anywher and can thrive on almost ani food source.
6819	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus ''A specialist is China' panda, which eat almost noth but bamboo, or Australia' koala bear, which eat eucalyptu leav almost exclusively'' (pg 5). Both live off of on resource. Thei ar differ from the python becaus it can live anywher with the assist of technolog unlik koala bear and pandas.
6820	3	Panda bear ar similar to koala bear becaus one, thei ar both a type of bear and two, thei eat grass & plants. Thei ar differ then python becaus python ar reptil and thei eat thing whole.
6821	3	In the articl the author tell us that China' panda eat almost noth but bamboo and the Australia' koala bear exclusiusv eat eucalyptu leaves. Both anim realli eat on thing. A python is veri differ it doesnt eat on thing it swallow it meal there for it veri different.
6822	3	Panda and koala are.''specialist'' mean that thei ar not as abund as generalists. A python is a generalist. Accord to the article, a python can adapt more easili while a koala, fore example, ''eat eucalyptu leav almost exclusively.''
6823	3	"Panda & koala ar similar to each other becaus thei ar specialist each onli eat food that is specif to a custom area of tri globe. But python ar generalist thei eat meat & onli requir a certain climat for exampl ""A python swallow an alligator"" that wouldn't happen in their homeland."
6824	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus panda' onli eat bamboo and koala bear eat eucalyptu leav there and sourc is not everi where thei both cant just move from China or Australia becaus there food is not made everi where around the world.
6825	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus each on need to stai their own habitat becaus thei cannot live without the sourc that their habitat give them. Thei both ar differ from python caue python could addapt in ani environ For exampl on the paragraph 21, the author give us a reason for why the panda and koala can't live in other environment.
6826	3	China' panda and Australia' koala ar similar in that thei basic onli consum on type of plant each. Panda eat bamboo and koala eat eucalyptu leaves. These two anim ar differ from python becaus python eat other species.
6827	3	Panda and koala ar both the same becaus thei onli eat certain things. Thei ar also both specialists. Thei ar differ from python becaus thei ar specialist and python ar generalists. Python have a varieti of food thei eat while the panda and koala don't.
6828	3	Panda in China ar similiar to koala in Austraila becaus thei ar both specialist & onli eat on thing. Panda mainli eat bamboo & koala eat eucalyptus. These ar differ from a python becaus python can eat anyth that come in their way. Python is a generalist.
6829	3	As you can see, panda in China ar similar to koala in Austria becaus thei ar both specialist animals. Also, the panda and koala ar herbivores, on eat bamboo and the other eat eucalyptu leaves. In addition, both the panda and koala ar differ from the python becaus thei ar specialist anim and thei ar carnivor meat eaters. Therefore, panda and koala ar actual differ from pythons.
6830	3	China' panda bear eat almost noth but bamboo, and Australia' koala bear eat eucalyptu leav almost exclusively. These bear ar differ from python eat meat sources.
6831	3	"Panda & koala ar similar becaus their both a specialist, as a python is a generalist. The articl says, ""A generalist is a raccoon, a python,..A specialist is China' panda... or Australias' koala""."
6832	3	Panda in china and koala in Australia ar alik becaus thei both ar plant eaters. For exampl in paragraph 21 thei sai that a panda and koala ar specialist. Panda and koala ar differ than python becaus python ar carnivor thei eat aliv thing and as I said in paragraph 20 it sai python ar generalists.
6833	3	Chines panda and Australian koala ar similar becaus thei ar both specialist species. Thei onli flourish and surviv in a veri specif area. For example, panda eat almost noth but bamboo, and koala eat eucalyptu leav exclusively. However, python ar generalist species. Thei can surviv almost anywhere. The articl state that the speci that have becom most abund ar those that do best in and around humans.
6834	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus both of them can onli live off on food source. Thei cannot live anywher els becaus thei need that specif thing found onli in their enviorment. Python howev can live off mani things, thei can live in differ envior and eat differ rats, that how thei live across the world.
6835	3	How panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia is thei both eat almost on thing all the time. Panda eat almost noth but bamboo, and the koala bear which eat eucalyptu leav almost exclusively. And how their both differ from a python is that thei don't eat anyth when their hungeri , a python will eat what ever anim or human it can get.
6836	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei have a certain food that like to eat. Python ar differ becaus thei eat anything.
6837	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia because, thei eat basic on thing, plants. The python eat a lot of differ kind of anim and such.
6838	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei both eat mostli on type pf food, like panda eat almost noth but bamboo, and koala eat eucalyptu leav almost exclus as state in paragraph 21. Panda and koala ar differ from python becaus python eat almost everyth unlik panda and koalas.
6839	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei ar both specialist and thei onli eat plant and python eat mammals. Accord to the article, panda almost onli eat bamboo and koala eat eucalyptu leav exclus so that shown that thei ar noth like pythons.
6840	3	The Chines panda and Australia' koala ar both similar becaus thei both eat special type of food. Thei ar both specialist accord to the article. Both the Chines panda and the australian koala ar differ than python b/c the python is a generalist that can adapt to differ food scources.
6841	3	Panda in China and koala in Australia ar similar becaus thei depend on what the environ bring them (such as bamboo or eucalyptu leav 'thei depend on those sourc to be there or they'll have troubl surviv however, python ar veri differ becaus thei on there habitat such as were thei live & climat changes.
6842	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei can both live off on plant, bamboo and eucalyptu leaves. Thei ar both differ from python becaus thei don't pose ani threat like python do. You won't find a koala or a panda with a wood rat or an allig in it mouth like you mai a python.
6843	3	Panda in china ar similar to koala becaus thei ar both specialist and need certain thing to surviv while python ar generalist and need less specif thing to survive. We live in an ag that favor generalist rather than specialists. Python ar differ becaus of how thei adopt.
6844	3	"Panda and koala ar quit similar in that both speci have adapt immensli to their surround in that thei would probabl becom hopeless if on wa to be outsid of their home and found to adapt elsewhere, Thei ar consicttenca "" specialists"", Thei differ from python in that python ar "" Generalists"", the ultim generalist is arguabl a human being, can live anywher that is kashi the orbl of a python."
6845	3	Panda and koala ar both specialist. Thei also both have exclus diets. The panda eat almost noth but bamboo and the koala eat just eucalyptu leaves. A python is a reptil and the panda and koala ar mammals. The python is also carnivor where as the panda and koala ar omnivorous.
6846	3	Panda and koala bear ar similar becaus thei have stai in their nativ land and have adapt to the food on climat so thei will not be abl to surviv anywher els unlik the python which can surviv from Asia to live in the Everglad in Florida. Also int he articl it sai python ar a generalist speci panda ar specialist.
6847	3	"Both koala (in Australia) and panda (in China) or ""specialists."" Specialist have a small rang of diet, ""China' panda..eat almost noth but bamboo (and) Australia' koala bear eat eucalyptu leav almost exclus ar two great examples. Pythons, on the other hand, ar generalists, which mean thei have a greater varieti of prey. Thei ar expect to surviv better becaus thei don't reli on on singl prey."
6848	3	Panda in China and koala in Australia ar similar becaus thei ar both specialist species. That mean with the right food thei could basic live anywher thei want to. Thei ar differ from python becaus python will basic eat anyth but have to live in a hot tropic climate. So the two climat ar similar and alike.
6849	3	Panda and koala ar similar becaus thei both have leg and arms. Thei also have fur, and paws/claws. Thei ar differ from python becaus python do not have legs, fur, paws, or claws. Thei have on long slither body. Python like to kill, ''A snake like that come at you, you'd leav him alone.''
6850	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei come from the same family. Thei ar differ from python becaus China panda eat almost noth but bamboo and Australia koala bear eat eucalyptu and python eat everything.
6851	3	Panda and koala ar similar becaus thei both look just alike. But their differ from python panda and koala bear don't eat meat thei eat bamboo or eucalyptu leav while the python eat meat like (lion, tiger)
6852	3	Panda and koala ar similar becaus thier specialist speci who need sertain thing to servive. Thei ar not like the python becaus python ar generalist who can serviv in larg areas.
6853	3	The panda an koala ar similar becaus thei both ar specialist and thei both eat onli type of food. The differ between them and a python ar that python' eat almost anyth thei can get their hand on.
6854	3	Panda' from China and koala bear from Australia live off a restrict eat habit. China' panda strictli eat noth but bamboo, and koala onli eat eucalyptus. These type of anim ar specialists. A generalist wa said that can live anywhere. Thei adapt easi to there environment, like python do.
6855	3	"Thei ar both specialist species, as thei need a veri specif envior to surviv in (a panda)...eat almost noth but bamboo"" and a koala bear ""eat eucallyptu leav almost exclusively"". Both anim need resourc to surviv (bamboo or eucalyptus) that ar onli present in certain envior and area. The bamboo is found in China, and the eucalyptu leav in Australia, so the anim have limit habitats."
6856	3	The ar of the specialist of panda' show far that wich eat almost noth but bamboo, or Australia' koala bear which eat eucalyptu leav almost exclusively. The reason for that I think ar caus thei live thei grow what thei eat and speciali with what other anim thei live.
6857	3	Panda in china ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei ar both a type of bear for on and thei onli eat on thing. In the articl thei were compar becaus thei onli eat on type of food. Panda eat bamboo and koala eat eucalyptu leaves. Thei differ from python becaus python eat mani differ things. Also, python ar reptil while bear ar mammals.
6858	3	China' panda and Australia' koala differ from from pythons.Ther differ becaus panda' eat bamboo and koala' eat eucalyptu leaves. Python eat other animals.
6859	3	"Panda in China and koala ar similar becaus thei both specialists. Thei each eat on specif food and do well in a stabl environment. Python ar differ from both the panda and the koala becaus thei onli ar generalists; thei can surviv in a number of environ and ""do best in and around humans."""
6860	3	Panda and Koala ar similar because; thei both like warm least diffent from python becaus thei can't just chang climates. Thei half to adjust to it like a python can.
6861	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei both eat mainli on thing. Panda eat mostli bamboo and koala eat eucalyptu leav almost exclusively. Unlike these animals, snake eat a varieti of things. Snake mostli eat other anim of live things.
6862	3	Both Panda and Koala ar specialist and a python is a generalist. In paragraph 19-21, it explain that generalist live well with human and can adapt well, a python would be abl to do that. It also sai that specialist panda + Koala need specif food to live; so thei would not be abl to live well with humans.
6863	3	Panda in China and koala in Australia ar similar becaus thei onli eat on type of food which is bamboo for panda and eucalyptu leav for koalas. While python ar abl to eat mani type of food and adapt to other sources.
6864	3	"Panda in China and koala in Australia ar both specialists, which the articl defin as anyth that need stability. The articl also sai that "" a generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white inland deer"". Thei ar abl to like human live in man other place and thrive of a mani differ things."
6865	3	"Panda in China and koala in Australia ar similar becaus thei ar both specialists. China' panda ""eat almost noth but bamboo"" and Australia' koala ""eat eucalyptu leav exclusively."" Thei ar differ from python becaus python ar generalist that can live anywher and eat anything."
6866	3	Panda in China ar anim that onli eat bamboo and koala in Australia onli eat eucalyptu leaves. Thei ar both similar becaus thei both reli on 1 food source. Python eat all kind of rodant and panda and koala bear reli on 1 food source.
6867	3	The panda and the Koala bear ar alik becaus thei aren't eat peopl or other animals. Panda eat bamboo and Koala eat eucalyptu leaves, thei ar also alik becaus thei ar specialist. Panda and Koala ar differ from python becaus a python is a generalist and python ar view as a threat to societi thei ar danger and eat other anim and possibl humans.
6868	3	Panda' and koala' ar similar becaus thei eat tree' and python' eat anyth thei see becaus their hungry. Panda' and koala' don't kill anim but python' spit' venon at an anim or human. Panda' and koala' ar friendli and python' ar evil.
6869	3	"Panda from china ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei ar both specialist species. ""A specalist is china' panda which eat almost noth but bamboo or Australia 's koala bear which eat eucalyptu leav almost exlusively"" .Thei ar both differ from python becaus python ar generalists."
6870	3	Panda in china and koala in Australia ar both specialists,thei can onli surviv in a stabl environ as thei surviv on certain plants(food),l bamboo and eucalyptu leav and need certain climate.Python ar generalist which can surviv in a rapidli chang environ on multipl food and climates.Accord to the articl a generalist can live anywher from Florida to Antarctica (or other species). A specialist can be a panda eat almost noth but bamboo.
6871	3	As it sai in paragraph 21, both the panda and koala ar specialist which mean that thei both need a certain thing to keep them alive. Python on the other hand need a vari climat to adapt quickli to add food sources. Thi mean generalists, like pythons, will throw out specialist becaus thei evolv better.
6872	3	"Chines panda and Australian koala ar similar becaus thei ar specialist. But is difficult for them to adapt to the chang world. The articl says, ""what favor specialist is stability. Right now mankind ha chosen to mock the earth a rapidli chang place,""python ar generalist & can adapt easily."
6873	3	China panda eat noth but bamboo, and Australia' koala bear eat eucalyptu leaves.
6874	3	China' panda ar similar to Australia' koala becaus thei ar both differ than python becaus first, python ar generalists. Panda basic onli eat bamboo and koala can eat onli eucalyptu leaves. Python and other generalist can eat about anything.
6875	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei ar both specialists. Thei onli eat on kind of food which is onli in the place that thei ar nativ to. Thei both ar differ from a python becaus the python can eat ani kind of animal. o if thei bad to surviv in differ place thei could becaus thei would have food there.
6876	3	Koala in china ar similar to koala in Australia becaus both of these anim ar know in their countri .Both thees anim have repul in their country.Thei ar boith differ from the python becaus python arn't know to be a specif countri thei ar all over the world.
6877	3	Panda and koala ar similar by the fact that thei ar categor as generalists. Each anim ar specif affect to the food in their country, such as the panda in China eat almost noth but bamboo and the koala eat exclus eucalyptu leaves.
6878	3	"In the stori ""one man' pet, another' invas species,"" Panda in china eat almost noth but bamboo or Australia koala bears, eat eucalyptus. Thei both differ becaus panda and koala ar similar to a bear and python ar snakes."
6879	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia by both of them be a specialist. Also thei both onli eat on type of food. Panda eat bamboo while koala eat eucalyptu leav as state on paragraph 21. Thei also differ from python becaus python ar generalist which is said on paragraph 20.
6880	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei ar both specialist and have mainli on food source. Panda and koala ar differ from python becaus unlik panda and koalas, python have a vast varieti of food thei can eat and thei can live anywher that ha the similar climat as asia.
6881	3	Panda in China ar similar to koala in Australia becaus thei both don't eat meat and they'r both not invasive. The python is invas and eat meat.

Thi show that the govern think thei ar reproduc at a too rapid rate. Also there is anoth side to it of peopl that think ''even the term''invas species'' is unfair, they'r introduced.'' Thi also show that some peopl think that thei ar not.
9908	4	Invasiv is a veri term throughout thi article. For example, there' differ new in thi articl about the term invas to describ the reptiles. The articl states, that biologist sai the invas species, ar major threat to biodiversity. However, MacInn disagre by saying, the term invas speci is unfair, and that it' a pass judgement.
9909	4	"What thei mean by ""invasive"" is that the anim ar invad area that they'r not suppos to be in. Thei call all the reptil invas becaus thei aren't suppos to be there."

10129	4	"The word invas mean ""pass judgement"". Some biologist sai that invas species, uncheck by natur predators, ar major threat to biodiversity."
10130	4	In the context of the article, invas describ speci that ar not nativ to a certain area but ar introduc by human to the habitats. The signific is that the articl delv into the debat over the invas species.

10132	4	The word invas mean someth that invad or take over mani call the python in the everglad invas becaus thei invad or take over mani territori and leav the popul of mani endang species.

10136	4	Invasiv mean harmful, which is what the python is to other anim that ar be eaten by it! python can caus extinct for animals. The python is harm to biodiversity, and ar ''major threats'' sai biologist in the articl on man' pet anther' invas species.
10137	4	"""Invasive"" is a word for anim who ar not nativ to thi country, state or city. Biologist sai that invas speci ar a threat, invas speci mai lizzards, all type of snake and scorpion."
10138	4	I think when the author wrote the word invasive, I think he meant outragious, becaus thi stori wa about exot anim like snakes, and other dangerous animals.
10139	4	"The word ""Invasive"" is import becaus these kind of anim ar not check by predat as state in the articl and thei ar a harem to biodivers also state in article."
10140	4	Invasiv kind of mean harm to. In the articl it talk about how the U.S. Thu black the radl of some coinmerci attenct anim becaus the fear thei ar invasive. And that anim like the python ar eat ar enviorment.
10141	4	In my opinion the word ''invasive'' mean someth about treading. For example, Biologist see the trade in nonn creatur as a factor in the rise number of invas species. Also, MacInn contend that the govern over estim the threat pose by invas reptiles.
10142	4	In the context of thi article, invas describ speci that ar introduc into nativ ar and disrupt the food chain of that place. An exampl would be the python in the southern U.S.
10143	4	"The word""invasive""mean introduct to someth new. ""Invasiv species"" is unfair,they'r introduced"" invas is pass judgment."
10144	4	"The word ""invasive"" is describ speci of anim that ar brought over to a habitat that is not nativ to them. Thei can drastic alter the entir ecosystem. RobRoi MacInn argu that it' okay, and that they'r mere be ""introduced."""

Thi articl provid point or view from either side such as the fact that python can swallow allig or that over u. million household have reptil pets. A reader is suppos to us these articl and gener these own opinion on whether reptil ar ""invasive."""
10147	4	Invasiv is probabl the most import word in the article. It is import becaus it describ how python and other anim are. In paragraph 9, it sai how invas speci that aren't detur by other predat can have a huge effect on biodiversity. Thi mean that the invas speci would take out other speci without competit from predators.
10148	4	The signific of the word invas wa to show how these reptil ar becom a major prambl and pretti soon everi where and there becom more popular becaus thei also can inhabit climat to live almost anywher so thei know start to come in to common space of land. In the articl it state ''No on know how the snake went native.''
10149	4	The articl us invas throughout the articl to talk about the speci such as python ar spread and lead other anim to extinction. The author us invas to talk about speci that ar multipli and take over in new environments.
10150	4	"""Invasive"" mean basic invading. As in invad land or something. Mac Inne states, ""Even the term 'invasive' speci is unfair. They'r 'introduced'.

10151	4	The word invas is signifig in thi articl becaus it describ the mean of how some anim got to the U.S. Python for exampl thei put as pet but when loos go anywher and 'invade' natur anim habitat and take their food.
10152	4	"The signific of the word ""invasive"" in thi articl is that it explain the anim a lot in thi article. Thei call the reptil invasive, becaus some peopl believ thei do not make good pet and thei could be dangerous."
10153	4	"The word invas mean introduc becaus thei ar reffer to danger uncommon reptil com into the unit states. For exampl in the articl it sai ""Biolgist sai that invas species, uncheck by natur predat ar a major threat to bio diversity."""
10154	4	Invasive, in refer to anim is a speci that is introduc to a differ habitat. Thi speci is said to be a threat to the natives, accord to biologist. Therefor thei greatli effect the biodivers in the given area.
10155	4	Invasiv mean like danger of or a lot of it. The rest of the articl is talk about all these bad anim veri invas in the wild and also mayb mean someon venmousl dangerus pet or a pet thei can add more monei too.
10156	4	It is import becaus the word invas mean like an invasion. And an invas of the python would be like what is happen to the Unite States. Thei have never live there befor but now do. It would not be an invas if thei were not threaten biodiversity.
10157	4	Invasiv mean a larg amount of something. In thi passag the invas thing is reptil and thei ar growing.

But it' not. Your put anoth anim in danger like rats. Also some anim can't adapt to their new climat chang and thei shouldn't have to. We should just leav them."
10161	4	The word invas is gener us when intrud on someth or not wanted. In the artic thei ar state thei want more anim to be introduc rather than be invasive. Thei foel invas is the wrong word when sai more anim should be introduced.
10162	4	The signific of the word invasive, is basic let us know that some peopl find these speci ( pythons) sort of like an intrud to their 'environment'. Thei don't feel comfort with some of thing deal with the species, and it pose major threats. ''Invasiv speci ar major threat to ecodiversity.
10163	4	The word invas is veri import to thi articl becaus it describ the reptil that ar be kept as hous pets. Python that escap from their where caus disturbances, and as the articl says, the invas speci be found in America could ruin our bio diversity.

But Biologist sai that, ""Invasiv species, uncheck by natur predators, ar major threat to biodiversity."" So invas can also mean have a great threat to other nativ speci in the area."
10284	4	What thei mean mean by invas is that in the actitec sinc the python ar spread more over the south. There try to sai that the word mean invade, so basic there try to invad in the southern part of the USA.
10285	4	"The word ""invasive""i signific to thi articl becaus it decscrib the reptil well. Thei can be veri terrotori and as it sai in the article, thei have claws, fang and mani other thing you wouldn't want to get hurt by."
10286	4	"Pertain to thi articl the word ""invasive"" is veri import when ""invasive"" is mention it is talk about foreign animals. These anim such as python and lizard ar find a home in area that aren't suitabl for them. Thei ar invat or be invasive."
10287	4	"The signific of the word ""invas is that I think mean that these speci do not belong or would not normal be found in that locat like peopl ar take the speci from thi foreign natur habitat and bring them into new habitat and the speci ar caus harm to the new habitats."
10288	4	The signific of the invas is describ how the pet come about .The govern believ that the invas anim tool over the new land why MacInn feel that these new anim were just introduc the the new region the word is us in order to describ the two differ view points. One is invas of the land while the other view part is just introduct is it.
10289	4	The signific of the word invas is a sign of someth deadli or someth harm that will danger other thing for instanc speci that will danger other species. Invasiv is a term that is mostli us on big and harm speci that eat other speci which in thi case the pythons, panda and the koalas.
10290	4	Invasiv mean someth like intruder. It mean introduc without be welcome. I think thi becaus in paragraph 7 Mac Inne sai . They'r introduced.' I think that invasive' Is pass judgement.
10291	4	"The word invas mean that the anim or thing is now, it tell about how it can be either good or harm to allow invas speci into an area. The reason why is becaus MacInn explain that python ar introduc and invas is just ""passing"" judgement."
10292	4	"The word "" invasive"" is veri import to thi articl becaus it is part of the main topic the articl is describing. Pire non speci a "" wonder introduction"" or all invas threat"". Animal like python ar invad territori and pass major threat to biodiversity. "" thei ar not help the environment. instead thei ar take over territori in invading, and caus major changes. The word invas insist that a bad thing s happening."
10293	4	NSR
10294	4	"Invasiv must make the anim viciou or make them look bad becaus in the text paragraph 7 it sai ""Even the tern invas speci is unfair"", it also sai ""I think invas is pass judgement"". So im guess it' someth that they'r not."
10295	4	The word invas mean pass judgement, the reptil in thi articl ar invas becaus most peopl look at onli the bad in these reptiles, and the reptil ar not even that bad. So in other word peopl pass judg these reptil becaus of their looks.
10296	4	Invasiv mean Able to take over so when the author said python can be Invasiv mean thei could end up be all over the place like streets, houses, car and I would be a disaster.
10297	4	"To Robroi Mac Innes, reptil ar enjoy pet who ar harmless to the outsid world. To a wildlif Biologist in Everglad Nation park, reptil ar invasive. He argu that ""snake ar imperl five endang speci in Florida keys"", (Achenbach,4), intrud on wild life. Snake have now becom nativ to the area and have becom invas becaus python had escap from pet owner and introdud to other area such as the Everglades."
10298	4	The word invas relat to the speci thei bring into the countries, from other countries. Bioligist sai that thei ar threat to biodiversity. Just bring exot anim in the USA, will caus problem with the biodivers of the anim in the future.
10299	4	Thei snake wa breakin awai from home so thei could invad sombodi els town and make that there home.
10300	4	"Speci that spread into other habitat and becom the new nativ speci ar known as invas speci as MacInn said. the speci ar more ""introduced"" becaus we brought them here, thei did not invad the U.S."
10301	4	Invasiv help show how bad bring & chang can habit. In the stori it states,''mani invas speci undergo a lag befor proliferating,'' which is bad for the animal.
10302	4	The word Invasiv is us in thi articl becaus reptil can be consid invasive, Thei easili frighten people. A parent is requir in same place to bui a monitor lizard or some snakes. Biologist sai that invas speci ar theat to biodiversity.
10303	4	"The word invas simpl mean intruder. In the article, skip snow said, "" the snake ar imperil five endang speci in the Florida keys"". He is sai that not onli ar these invas speci ar that over, but thei ar also corrupt the ""norm"" of the Florida keys."
10304	4	The signific of the word invas to the rest of the articl is that there ar anim that eat other anim and will prei on them.
10305	4	"The word ""invasive"" in the articl is signifi as traveling. That is becaus in the articl there ar some part in which it talk about how some of the invas speci can be major threat to bio divers when not check by natur predators. That it can remov the natur barrier and anyth can go anywhere."
10306	4	The word ''invasive'' is us veri often in thi article. Peopl ar sai that reptil and python ar ''invasive'' which mean wild. When realli at least 4.8 million household own a reptil as a pet. Thi articl goe into a lot of depth about invas creatures.
10307	4	"The word ""invasive"" is veri signific to thi article. Thi is becaus thi whole articl talk about these pythons, which ar invasive. The word ""invasive"" is us mani time throughout the article."
10308	4	Thei ar call invas becaus thei ar invad the Unite States. Thei werent suppos to be in the Unite State anyway.
10309	4	"In thi artic invas is not the best term to call it. Some peopl believ that invas is unfair and thei should be cale introduc instead. ""I think it is the best thing to happen to the everglad in the last 200 years"" state it is not such a bad thing as invas seem to point to."
10310	4	"invas is veri import to the article. It is what will defin peopl perspectives. When I think of invasive, I think of someth forc their self in. contridectingli it wa said that ""they'r introduced"" and that python ar not invasive."
10311	4	Invasiv is signific becaus it explain how danger the python are. Thi is becaus the articl tell how thei ruin ecosystem.
10312	4	The signific of the term ''invasive'' is that the speci ar ''uncheck by natur predators,'' thi mean that these anim ar normali predators, yet thei ar be kept as pet while normaly, prei like rat and fish ar kept as pets.
10313	4	"Invasiv mean the kind of speci elimin other species. It is believ in thi articl that invas is pass judgement, and unfair, becaus peopl don't look past the snakes' fangs, skin, climat need & eat habits. Some peopl like MacInnes, ""think it' the best thing to happen""."
10314	4	The term invas is signific in thi articl becaus it refer to speci that wa introduc into an area and neg impact the environment. These reptil invad the habitat and ar veri difficult to petridat and peopl do not realiz thi when thei bui them. Thei ar invad new habitats.
10315	4	"The signific of the word invas is quit simple. More and more speci ar be brought to the Unite State that don't usual live here. Thei ar be ""introduced"" to the environ and sometim set free unto the wild creat a popul here."
10316	4	"The word ""invasive"" is signific to the articl becaus the articl is explain how python were brought on to the everglad and ar kill all of the nativ species. ""The snake he says, us impurit five endang speci in the Florida keys. ""Thi quot show that ""invasive"" speci act fast and domin when introduc to a new habitat."
10317	4	Invasiv would mean bring the creatur where thei should be, where thei don't belong you know thei shouldn't be here.
10318	4	The word invas relat to the rest of the articl becaus it is brought up numer times. It mean a speci ha move to an area becaus of a factor. It relat to the articl b/c it is a clear detail of why anim ar where thei are.
10319	4	"Invasiv is signific to thi articl becaus it describ a speci come from on place to anoth and possibl harm ecosystem of the new place it settl in the invas speci describ in the articl is the python, and now it could possibl be invad a park in Florida. The articl states, ""the us number of invas species, such as the Burm python."""
10320	4	The word invas is so signific in mani wai invas speci under go a lag befor Prolifer python were seen by the region of Evergrades.
10321	4	"The signific of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the articl is that the articl is talk about reptil and snake invad new habitat and disrupt the environment. Becaus of these invas species, mani speci ar becom endangered."
10322	4	"The wai the author us invas in thi articl wa that thei said it meant dangerous. I know thi becaus in the articl it said ""Nine monitor lizard, A toothi carnivor that can reach sever feet in length and ha found a happi home along the canal of cape coral."" That paragraph sai thei ar better where thei ar than your home."
10323	4	Invasiv speci could includ a snake of some sort; but that doesn't mean all snakes. Some snake ar be found in place that thei wouldn't suspect so many, and it' unusu and dangerous, make snake an invas species.
10324	4	Call a speci invas present an instant neg connotation, wherea other term invit less object reactions. Thi is support in paragraph 7, where reptil dealer macInn describ us the term 'invasive' as pass judgement on these animals.
10325	4	Invasive, probabl mean someth extrem of danger becaus thi articl is talk about extrem and danger things.
10326	4	Invasiv is meant as someth invad someth else. For example, the python increas in popul is slowli invad the lower part of the Unite States. The python popul in the U.S. is invasive.
10327	4	"Invasiv speci ar anim ""uncheck by natur predat [and] major threat to biodiversity"" (Achenbach). These anim could kill whole speci of anim becaus there is noth higher in the food chain to beat it."
10328	4	"An invas speci is a non-n speci that ha been introduc to an area. Some peopl like the article' Skip Snow, in paragraph eleven call reptilian pet invas in the wild and lament the wai thei put nativ speci at risk. Others, like reptil pell RobRoi MacInn in paragraph seven, dislik the term ""invasive"" feel it pass judgement. MacInn prefer ""introduced""."
10329	4	"The word ""invasive"" is import becaus it show that the python ar spread to territori thei wouldn't normal be. The generalist python ar ""invading"" other anim environ as shown on the map of potenti habitat where reptil take up the entir south. Also the anim ar invas becaus a wood rat wa eaten by a python that invadad it' territory. The word invas is import becaus it show how python ar take over."
10330	4	"The signific of the word 'invasive' in thi articl is like discrimin against reptil becaus thei don't look like a good pet such as furri dog. As it sai in the article, the term ""invas species"" is unfair. The articl also sai that, ""I think that 'invasive' is pass judgement."" Thi word that thei ar us to describ reptil is not give them a chance."
10331	4	"The signific of the word ""invasive"" is that the python and other reptil that ar be import ar slowli take over the area that thei ar inhabiting. Thei ar kill off nativ speci and ar invad the habitats."
10332	4	"Mac Inne think that inas is an unfair word. ""Even the term ""invas species"" is unfair, he said. They'r introduced. I think that inas is pass judgement."" Inasiv is a word toward the reptiles."
10333	4	The signific of the word invas is anoth word for vishous.
10334	4	"The word ""invasive"" mean that these speci go and invad somewher in a new habitat. Invasiv mean thei havent alwai been there, but RobRoi MacInn sai ""The term ""invas speci is unfair. They'r introduced."" as it sai in paragraph seven."
10335	4	The articl is talk about typic pet such as fish, cats, dogs, vs invasive. Invasiv is basic sai anim that normal aren't suppos to be kept as pets, or ar rare kept such as snakes, and other reptillas.
10336	4	Invasiv to me mean like we make anoth speci to U.S country. It is like we produc a new anim in U.S.
10337	4	Invasiv - mean not introduced, it a big part of the articl becaus pythons,lizards,reptil ar not known to be pet but scientist ar try to make it to peopl have them as pets.
10338	4	Invasiv mean mean and angry, becaus he sai ''even the term invas speci is unfair,'' & in the articl he is talk about how reptil and python aren't that mean & vaguar.
10339	4	"From Read thi articl I think the ward invas mean ""unknown"" The signific of thi word to the articl is that to some peopl these reptil ar unknown and questions, but on the other hand some of the reptil ar peopl pets. So that doesn't mean that these creatur ar ""invasive"" to everyone."
10340	4	Thei ar scare that viciou anim ar spread and kill off other species. But the signific is that thei will multiply.
10341	4	I think invas mean danerg anim that have to do with invading. The python ar invad the Everglad and other area thei usual aren't found.
10342	4	Invasiv is a big word in the article, becaus these creatur ar invad new land and caus troubl in the food chain. Their presenc alter the environment.
10343	4	The signific of the word ''invas ''to the rest of the articl is that the reptil ar danger sinc thei came from a wild habitat but is not a fair word to describ them. ''Even the term invas is unfair.''
10344	4	I think thei us the word invas as a judgmet to their work, they'r try to critises.
10345	4	The word invas mean like mean, cruel, danger and that how there describ the python becaus there aggress to eat anim or people.
10346	4	The signific of the word invas to thi stori is big becaus it' all about how mani place and how thei got invad by differ reptil and how can on becom on of them.
10347	4	"The word ""invasive"" is veri signific to the rest of the article. In thi articl invas describ the anim like the python who have been introduc to new land and take over. Thei have eaten mani of the anim that were their privous and their kind ha becom domin in an area which thei were not origin from. Scientist call these anim ""invasive"" to describ their doing."
10348	4	In thi articl invas is us to describ that the reptil ar be brought somewher thei don't realli belong and in some place ar slowli start to take over or at least harm the wildlife. Although Rooroi MacInn believ he is simpli ''introducing'' after the problem the reptil caus thei definatli ar invasive.
10349	4	"The signific of the word ""invasive"" in the articl is that the inclus anim were brought to unnatur locations, either by storm or by people. The articl sai that the anim ar ""introduced"" to new environ rather than the anim invad a new location."
10350	4	The word invas branch off the word invas which mean to take over in larg number when thei sai that certain anim ar invad mean that thei ar take over part of the us in larger numbers.
10351	4	''Invasiv is import to the articl becaus peopl have differ view on the us of thi word. MacInn sai that ''invasive'' is a pass judgement. Thi mean he think that ''invasive'' is the wrong word to use, on the other hand Skip Snow think that MacInnes' argument is ''ridiculous.'' He' sai that ''invasive'' is the perfect word to use.
10352	4	"The word ""invasive"" is import to the articl becaus MacInn sai in the articl that the term invas speci is ""unfair"" and should be ""introduc becaus invas is pass judgement"" Invasiv is put as speci that can pose a threat to biodivers becaus no on realli know what the speci can do becaus thei ar unchecked."
10353	4	"The articl sai ""Uncheck by natur predators, invas speci ar major threat to biodiversity"". So when peopl hear the phrase ""invas species"" thei get scarred. The articl provid an arguement on why thei shouldn't be, but also why the should."
10354	4	"There is a veri distinct signific to the word ""invasion"" in thi article. The word ""invasion"" in thi articl mean when an anim is brought into a countri or accident brought into a coutry. Either wai it invad the new area."
10355	4	The onli reason the word invas describ what is happen is becaus we don't want them.
10356	4	The signific of the word invas in the articl is that, it seper peopl that think the speci ar invas to the on that think thei ar bet and thei ar call invas ewas thei ar not suppos to be there.
10357	4	"The signific of the word ""invasive"" is unfair to said. As said in the article, ""even the term invas speci is unfair, he said. They'r 'introduced', I think that 'invasive' is pass judgement."""
10358	4	"Mani peopl ar the word invas to describ reptil peopl who like python see invas as a veri judgement and neg word "".Even the term invas speci is unfair, he said there introduced. I think that 'invasive' is a pass judgement."
10359	4	''Invasive'' refer to ''invas species.'' Thei ar speci not nativ to their environment. Becaus thei usual don't have predators, thei ar major threat to biodiversity. Thei ar abl to compet with and kill nativ species, deplet their population. In other word ''invasive'' speci disrupt their current habitat ecosystem. Thei ar not suppos to belong there. Therefore, thei ar consid ''invasive.''
10360	4	Invasiv mean invading. It is signific to the rest of the articl becaus it is talk about whether or not Burmes python is an invas species.
10361	4	"The word ""invasive"" is signific to the rest as the articl becaus it is us to describ both reptil and humans. The main idea of the articl is that reptiles, especi python and other snakes, have invad habitat and ar take control for example. In the ever giadu python destroi the natur food chain and on at an alligator. Human also seem to invad other anim territori and adapt ourselv to it while rune their home."
10362	4	That all reptil ar becom hous pet now.
10363	4	I think the word invas kind of mean the same as indang or someth I'm not sure.
10364	4	The signific to the word invas in the articl is describ what peopl sai reptil are. Thei ar introduc them to a new place in peopl home when thei have them as pets.
10365	4	Like it sai in the articl invas speci undergo a lag befor multipli or spreading. It signific becaus it tell all about what the snake do. Thei do noth for a littl then when thei feel it time then start multiplying.
10366	4	RoiRoi McInne sai that the term invas is unfair. Invasiv describ someth that enter a local societi or group without permiss and caus possibl trouble. Thi articl deem some exot anim to be invasive.
10367	4	The word invas is like dustrib some on praviesy. Some peopl wouldn't want reptil in the hous as live next to them becaus what if thei get lose.
10368	4	The signific of the word ''invasion'' is explain as a bad thing in the article. While some believ that invas is a best word to sai becaus thei think that if the anim can adapt, then thei belong there. But some sai they'r invad becaus thei would chose chang to the environ and to the speci that originated.
10369	4	"Biologists, sai that invas speci uncheck by natur predat ar major threat to biodiversity. Life on earth ha alwai move around, but never so fast. The term ""invas species"" is unfair, they'r introduc ""invasive"" is pass judgement."
10370	4	The word invas is us in the article. Python ar wild lethal reptiles. In the articl it sai that a hurrican wa respons for invad everywhere. Th chart show how the python invad from their home in Florida to across the state of California. Thi is the signific of word invasive.
10371	4	"The signific of thi word is how it describ the new speci and whether or not it is too quickli pass judgement. MacInn says, ""Even the term invas is unfair..."" (Achenbech). MacInn is point out that no real harm ha been done yet. However, park ranger in the everglod call hi argument, ""articulos..th snakes..imperi 5,,speaks"" (5)."
10372	4	"The signific of the mean of the word ""invasive"" mean wild and differ for me. In the articl explain the invas speci uncheck by natur predat and a major treat to biodiversity. That mani of these speci undergo a lag befor proliferating."
10373	4	The author explain in paragraph 19 that a python is a generalist and with the help of technolog can live anywhere. And in paragraph 21 he explain how koala and panda ar similar becaus thei ar specialists. Koala' exclus eat eucalyptu leav and panda just onli eat bamboo.
10374	4	The word Invasiv is signific to rest of the articl becaus it describ how the reptil have been brought into a new habitat. The articl sai that thei ar eat other speci of anim and disrupt the environ show that these reptil have taken over a new area of the world.
10375	4	The signific of the word Invasiv to the rest of the articl wa to prove that invas speci were anim that were veri attractive. Thei were veri over popul and had eat block somehow.
10376	4	"The signific of thei word invas in thi article, becaus thei call these reptil veri invasive. Even though thei aren't invasive. In paragraph #7 MacInn sai ""Even the ""term invas species' is unfair."" He believ that thei aren't invasive."
10377	4	Invasiv refer to a speci introduc in a larg population. Python origin in South American countries. When those python ar introduc to North American environ thei ar classifi as invas these python don't origin in North America and ar introduc rather than nativ born.
10378	4	"Someth that is invas is abl to come into a new area and thrive. In the case of thi articl snake ar invas becaus thei ar ""uncheck by natur predators"" which make them major threat to biodiversity."" Introduc thing that ar invas is bad becaus other anim have not adapt to them be part of their ecosystem."
10379	4	"The signific of the word ""invasive"" in the articl is that thei feel that python ar almost all over the countri and that some peopl don't like it. ""Thei sai invas speci ar major threat to biodiversity."" Thei think thi anim ar danger and ar talk a lot of space."
10380	4	"The word invas is extrem import to the article. It is the titl of the article, ""one man' pet another' invas species"" Therefor it is the main concept of thi articl and what the author is try to get across to hi readers."
10381	4	The word invas is defin as harsh or mean. Thi word is signific becaus the whole articl talk about snake and reptil and how thei can be danger to have as a pet or just out in the wild. Peopl don't want those invas anim out there harm the endang speci like in Florida Keys.
10382	4	"From the usag of the word ""invasive"" in the context I figur it meant grow popul of out of the countri species. Thi word is signific to the text becaus that' how python were labeled. MacInn made a statement saying,"" .... I think 'invasive' is pass judgement."" Biologist felt that these "" invasive"" creatur ar "" major threat to biodiversity."""
10383	4	"The word invas ha a signific meaning. RobRoi MacInn believ ""the term invas is unfair. Thei ar introduc and invas is pass judgement. ""The python didn't ""invade"" America thei were bought on and ""introduced."""
10384	4	MacInn contend that the gover overestim the treat pose by invas reptiles. He sai he' be block by the U.S.
10385	4	In the articl is sai that the word invas speci is unfair he said. Thei introduc . I think that invas is pass judgement . Thi relet to the articl you do not see mani peopl todai with snake as their pets.
10386	4	"The signific of the word ""invasive"" is to get the read atenion about speci that ar invad and kill nativ speci such as the "" Kei largo wood rat fand in the belli of a python""."

12799	5	It goe to the mitochondria and then it follow the endoplasm reticullum. It stop at the Golgi Apparatu where it is packag and then it is sent out in a vessicl to other part of the cell.
12800	5	Ribosomo and mitochordia both creat proteins.
12801	5	It ha to make it to the mitochondria, then is goe to the membrane.
12802	5	mRNA leav the nucleu tRNA transport the amino acidsrRNS creat the protein
12803	5	The mRNA goe off to the rRNA stage to deliev the messag of what the rRNA need to code exactly. The rRNA then code what the mRNA said to code, which of cours then goe to the tRNA. The tRNA then bring the RNA strand to fuse with anoth RNA strand. Thus, the two strand becom a DNA strand.
12804	5	First, the mRNA leav the nucleus. Then, the mRNA travel and attach itself to a ribosome. The mRNA then find a codon that match up with it correct codons. When thei meet, thei will form on section of DNA. The mRNA continu thi process until the full strand of DNA is complete. Once complete, the mRNA will come to a stop codon, mean that the process of protein synthesi is complete.
12805	5	1. mRNA leav the nucleus2. copi of the mRNA is made3. chain the copi together4. goe to anoth nucleu
12806	5	In protein synthesi messeng RNA leav the nucleu and attach onto a ribosome. Transfer RNA get the inform from the messeng RNA for the amino acid sequence. Transfer RNA transfer the inform to the ribosom RNA. Codon then start to attch to the mRNA and form an amino acid sequence.
12807	5	The mrna would then be transcrib by the tRNA dure the process of replication. Thi would then make the Ribos RNa which is sent the the Golgi Apparatus, packagedm and sent out to the ribosom in order to build that particular protein.

12810	5	THE FOUR MAJOR STEPS ARE 1. FIRST IT GIVES YOUR BODY THE NUTRIENTS AND THINGS IT NEEDS.2. IT CLEANS YOUR BODY OUT.3. THE PROTEIN STARTS TO FILTER EVERY THING OUT.4. IT LEAVES YOUR BODY
12811	5	1. The mRNA goe down the electron transport chain.2. It gain high energi electrons.3. Exit the electron transport chain.4. Pass the electron to other part of the cell.
12812	5	first you have mRNA then you have the develop of the protein and next you have the life cycl of the protein then next yuo have the death of the proteien.
12813	5	mRNA will find anoth mRNA, then thei will be move to a protien and combined. Then thei will be sent to their destinations.
12814	5	Start with mRNA, the sequenc then would start at it Duplic of DNA and then transfer into RNA by transcription. After the fact, it would then go on with transolc by convert it into mRNA, by then the mRNA is do Replic by make more protein and ad to the body.
12815	5	1) Is when it leav it ha to get us it be gone.2) Is thei have to work to regain it back.3)I when thei ar start to regain it thei have to store it.4) Is when thei get it store thei have to make sure there is enough for everything.
12816	5	it goe to the ribosom to make new copys, the tRNA copi the mRNA, then send it to wherev it need to go.
12817	5	When mRNA leav the nucleus, it is transcript into tRNA. Then it is translat and you get the amino acids. The amino acid then have their anticodon that ar opposit of the codon for the amino acids.
12818	5	Anaphase, which is where the nuclou and organel disappear. Metaphase, where the dna all line up down the middle. Telophase, where thei split into two. Prophase.
12819	5	mRNA then travel through your bodi and the connect to your codon creat an amino acid which form your DNA sequences. It then transfer into to tRNA and that then creat an amino acid which form a codon which then form our DNA.

12990	5	The mRNA take the RNA to the animo acid sequenc so it can be made. The rRNA help make the new RNA and then take it to the tRNA. The tRNA then transfer it back to the nucleu where it is used.
12991	5	The dna uncoils. The Rna becom sinfl stranded. The dna is transformed. The dna is rezipped.
12992	5	thei copi the DNA, thei take it out of the nucleus, thei make a new strand, and copi that
12993	5	After mRNA finish it them goe to the tRNA and tell it whow to copi the DNA while in the proce Then come the codon and come and take the copi DNA and seperated.
12994	5	goe out the nucleu into the cell membran into the ribosom and out the cell wall
12995	5	The mRNA will go through anaphas and then inaphase, then metaphas and final telaphase.
12996	5	mRNA leav the nucleu and goe onto the ribosomes. The ribosom then take the messeng RNA and transfer them. The ribosom carri the mRNA to tRNA. The transfer RNA the goe into the DNA sequence. You go from mRNA to the ribosom to tRNA and then to the final product.
12997	5	The mRNA find a chain of codon in the nucleu to be taken out. Then the tRNA transfer thi chain out of the nucleus. Then rRNA recod the codon into the pattern of RNA and make RNA with other protien too.
12998	5	The step ar transportation, Translation, Replication, & nutriationm. Thei all halp provid for the cell, give it wehat it will need, and suppli for it.
12999	5	First, the mRNA would carri the instruct for the amino acid sequenc of a protein into the cytoplasm. Second, the tRNA would receiv these instructions, find the need amino acids, and carri them to the ribosome. Third, the rRNA would bind amino acid with the codon to the ribosome. Fourth, the amino acid with the anticodon would be attach to the amino acid with the codons, which would result in a protein.
13000	5	The first step is transcription.Th second step is ?The third step is translation.Th fourth step is ?
13001	5	it make a copi strand, take the copi strand out side of the nucleus, make a copi of the amino acid, and multiplies.

13011	5	after it leav the mRNA, it goe to a peptide.ther it is transcribed.then it is sent to rRNa.
13012	5	mRNA leav the nucleas, goe through the cytoplasm, enter the rRNA and then thei make the amino acid accord the the copi DNA.
13013	5	when mrna leav tjhe nucleu the procc begin by interphas then prophas then metaphas then anaphas
13014	5	The mRNA is edit and the unwant part of the sequenc ar destroyed. Then translat occurs. The mRNA sequenc is sent the the ribosom where rRNA is. The ribosom read the mRNA by codons. The tRNA then bring an anticodon to attatch to the mRNA. The chain of amino acid form a protein.
13015	5	Step on would be mRNA leav the nucleu and enter the ribosome. Step two would be when the tRNA with a protien on top and a codon on bottom come and thei attach the anticodon with the mRNA' anticodons. Step three would be after the tRNA attach to the anticodon and leaves, it leav behind an amino acid. Step four would be after sever tRNA' come and go, and the amino acid' join togeth form a polypeptid chain, which later becom a protein
13016	5	The mRNA deliv the messag to tRNA. Then the tRNA chang it into proteins.
13017	5	interphaseprophaseanaphas telophas
13018	5	Once the mRNA leav the nucleus, it goe to a ribosome. At the ribosome, iniat occur when a tRNA molecul with the anti-codon UAC bind to the codon AUG, code for the amino acid Met and start the synthesi of the protein. Next, elong occur as more tRNA molecul bind to codon and form peptid bond in between the amino acid to build the protein. When the tRNA come upon a Stop codon, the new protein break off in the process of termin and goe into the cell. Last, the ribosom complet the process by disassembly, get readi for a new mRNA molecule.
13019	5	mRNA goe and make copi of itself. Then thei give it to the amino acids, Then the amino acid get everyth thei need to make protein. Then thei make protein.
13020	5	The four major step involv in protein synthesi is that it send messsag to the nucleu .
13021	5	One, RNA carri instruct from the nucleu to proteins.Two, The protein carri it somewher important.I dont know.

13040	5	When the mRNA leav the nucleus, it enter a ribosome. At the ribosome, translat start to take place. Anti-codon ar pair with codon to make polypeptid sequences. Codon consist of three of the following: adenine, uracil, cytosine, or guanine. Thei can go in ani order such as AAA, UAU, GUU, CUA, and mani mani other combinations. Complementari codon ar like the opposit becaus thei work in pairs. Adenin goe with uracil and Cytosin goe with guanine. Float nucleotid base ar drop off and put into order base on these complementari pairs. Then amino acid ar put into order as a polypeptid sequence.
13041	5	The mRNA leav the nucleu into the cytoplasm. Next the mRNA goe to the ribosome. When the mRNA arriv at the ribosom the codon (sequenc of three consecut nitrogen bases) ar translat into amino acids. The amino acid chain is assembl and it then leav the ribosome.

13159	5	The 4 major step ar mRNA leav the nucleus, then get move over to the ribosomes, then it get put with the anticodons, and the last part the protein get form into a chain type, result in protein synthesis.
13160	5	After the mRNA leav the nucleus, it then shift into tRNA which transport protein across the cell. After the protein had been transported, the process of RNA is shown, and it start to build a RNA molecule. After the RNA molecul is formed, it then form on side of a DNA molecule, then a DNA molecul is formed.
13161	5	mRna get and amino acid from there the amino acid goe to tRna and then is attach to nucleotid which from a protein
13162	5	give a messag to organisms, send for ribosomes, goe back to nucleus, and get more messag
13163	5	Thing in your bodi that give more oxygen each time.
13164	5	it almost like DNA but it not, becaus it procerd protein, mRNA and mDNA hi the same meaning, but it diffenernt becaus DNA is well blood and mRNA is protein
13165	5	The Amino acids, the DNA and the RNA
13166	5	move through the nucleu to the outsid of the cell car the amiuno acid code to be transcribes, trna. translat then you have proteins.
13167	5	The mRNA exit the nucleu and link to a ribosome. The ribosom attract amino acid and thei match up with their correspond nucleotides.
13168	5	Well start with mRNA you need to know everyth about the DNA, and the tRNA. Then you need to figur out the nuceotides, amino acid and what not. And also the strand of the DNA. Then final onc you get to the end of the singl or doubl strand DNA' you will have what you need to know.
13169	5	Protien synthesi give messag to the mRNA. the mRNA give the messag to the tRNA. the tRNA trnsfer the RNA to the rRNA. The rRNA send the messag to the gRNA.
13170	5	1) mRNA leav the nucleus2) mRNA separtes3) mRNA is absorb by the endoplasm reticulam4) mRNA is now protein
13171	5	1. The amaino acid have to leav the nucleu to make a copi of their protien.2. Then the Amaino acid break apart to creat a differtnet combin of portiens.3. The amaino acid then creat a new strand of codon to make up a protien.
13172	5	First it travel along to the ribosomes. Next, the ribosom give the mRNA it proper tRNA, which ha a strand of amino acids. Then, it is sent off. Finally, the proccess is repeated.
13173	5	The mRNA goe to the nucleus. The mRNA is read by the rRNA.The tRNA get the amino acids.Th amino acid match up with thier partners, creat protiens.
13174	5	mRNA leav the nulceus, travel to the endoplasm reticulum, then to cell membran and exit the cell.

13188	5	The mRNA leav the nucleus, then it go to the cyoplasm. Next, animo acid attach the mRNA. Last, mRNA is full with animo acids, then it break off the mRNA.
13189	5	First the mrna get the messag from the nucleus. Second the mrna transfer the messag to the amino acids.Third the amino acid copi the message.Fourth the new dna is made
13190	5	the mRNA take vacul
13191	5	In protein synthesi mRNA leav the nucleus, then goe to the ribosomes, the mRNA tell the ribosom how to make the protein, then the protein in created.
13192	5	tRNA translat the strand of DNA into a more readalb formrRNA read the strand and make more from it
13193	5	ANAPHASE INTERPHASE METAPASE PROPHASE
13194	5	After the mRNA got manufactured. The DNA that is expos to Nucletid base will pair up with the Ribosom and then it will be the tRNA and by that thei will produc protein and that happen insid the cytoplasm.
13195	5	In protein synthesis, on major step start when mRNA leav the nucleu through the the nuclear pore carri the inform need to make the proteins. It then enter a ribosome. Thi is becaus thi is where protein ar made.Th third thing is that the mRNA sequenc pair up into pair of three, make amino acids. The last step is that the amino acid code make the protein needed.
13196	5	The DNA connect to the mRNA.the mRNA goe throughout the bodi send the messag to the parts.
13197	5	1) mRNA chang into tRNA2) tRNA be replic thu chang into rRNA3)rRNA be it group of three that ar kei like structures4) The kei like structur turn into protein
13198	5	Then tRNA come to read the mRNA. Then thei follow the direct of mRNA. next thei get into there sequence.

13202	5	1)Protien enter the cell2)Protien go to the ribosomes3)Protien ar turn into energy4)Th energi made is us to perform everydai cell work
13203	5	The mRNA carri instruct from the nucleu for the amino acid of a protein. The tRNA tansfer the step of the amino acids.
13204	5	When mRNA leav the nucleus, it chang to tRNA. The tRNa then carri direct to the nucleu aboout how to assembl amino acids. the amino acid ar then assmbled. lastly, tRNA is chang into rRNA.
13205	5	it will move through the cell, collect thing from each part of the cell, get rid of thing it dont need, and turn in to RNA
13206	5	mRNA leav the nucleu to deliv the genet inform to the tRNA. The tRNA then transfer it to the ribosomes. It then goe back and get more. The rRNA link all of the inform together.
13207	5	1. First the mRNA is transcribed, and then it leav the nucleu and enter the cytoplasm.2. Second, the mRNA attach to ribosomes. The tRNA bring the correct codon to match with the mRNA.3. Third, the codon attach and start to form a polypeptid chain.4. Last, the tRNA will bring the last codon of the chain, call the stop codon. Thi signal that the polypeptid chain is done forming, and then the chain will be released.

13211	5	th e four major step in mRNA ar the messag get to the messeng RNA and the the mRNA get deliv to where it is susspos to go and the messag get to where it is suspos to go then action be taken.
13212	5	When mRNA leav the nucleu it goe through transcript where the mRNA is recopi into a new stand. The mRNA ha now done it job and the tRNA take over. The tRNA carri awai the new strand of RNA to a new locat where it is then us as needed.
13213	5	mRNA leav the nucleus.Rna leav intruct for the amino acid sequenc of a protein.
13214	5	mRNA live the nucleus, then it travel in the cytoplasm look for a Ribossome. One it fiend the ribbossom it goe in and rRNA take controll. rRNA put the amino acid in the correct order. Then tRNA will bring the anticodon to finish make the protein.
13215	5	The second step is when the RNA is brought out to the ribosomes. The third step is when the RNA is copied. The RNA then is check for mistakes. Then final the RNA get sent out to delvier the 'message' to the cell.
13216	5	In protein synthesis, step on is that mRNA us the star codon to start read the DNA strand. Second, it read and make a new strand. Third, it continuosli add on until it reach the stop codon which is the fourth step.
13217	5	The four step in protein synthesi would be: 1) mRNA leav the nucleu 2)made into protein 3)'Shipped' to rRNA 4)read and copi
13218	5	Becom RNA and then goe into the ribosom where it is then chang into protein
13219	5	The mRNA get convert by the rRNA switch the Ts out with Us. When the rRNA convers is done the tRNA come back through and convert it again also swap the Ts for Us.
13220	5	First the mRna leav the nucleus, Then it chang it code so it can get through. then it is transcrib back to it mRNA code so it can becom protein.

RNA process then occur and the genet code is given to the nucleus. Translat happen after the genet code reach the nucleus. Dure translation, the codon find their anti-codon in pair of 3 to start make amino acids. After 20 amino acids, there will be a stop codon indic the process to stop.
13339	5	The mRNA leav the nucleus. Then with the coil DNA sequence, it match up the correspond amino acids. Then it goe to the ribosom and drop off the amino acid that match. I thei don't match then thei go back and try to do it again. When thei do match it form an amino acid and then it form a protein.
13340	5	In protein synthesi after the mRNA leav the nucleus, the cell will need to make a copi of the mRNA. After copi it, it will be synthized. Then, the copi version and the origin version will be cross over to caus genet variat for the organism. Last, the cell will be sent out to the bodi to replac the on that can no longer do thier job efficiently.
13341	5	Four major step would be prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
13342	5	The nucleu leav the body.
13343	5	when mRNA leav the nucleu the ribosom take it to the golgi apparatus.Then, from there it goe to the mitochondria and then the nucleu
13344	5	annaphas prophas metaphas telephas
13345	5	The first step is the mRNA is unzip by a RNA polymerase. Then it is made into tRNA. After that it enter our DNA and lastli it is made into protein.
13346	5	htei ar manufactur and produc and us trhen excreat from the nucleu
13347	5	Well after the RNA leav the nucleu it make a sectiond strand that mach form the strand that it made to go with the DNA. It then turn in to TRNA witch turn the T bace in to a U bace and the U bace pear up with the A bace. Then thei canect with the RRAN to make the ameno acideds.
13348	5	mRNA carri instruct from the nucleu for the amino acid sequenc of a protein.
13349	5	mrna leav the nucleu
13350	5	mRNA leav the nucleu first, second thei get the ATP and thei take it to the mitochondria and thei let them know what thei have to fix, fourth thei go to the place where the cell need fixed, and fifth thei end up with protein synthesis.
13351	5	The mRNA leav the nucleus. The mRNA take a code to a ribosome. The amino acid in the ribosom translat the code and attach a respond to the tRNA. The tRNA goe back to the nucleu with with it code segments.
13352	5	mRNA enter the cytoplasm. It then carri instruct to the ammino acid sequence. Then it turn into tRNA and carri the complet sequenc off. From there it creat a protien.
13353	5	protein' gather together.protein attach to each other.in order to attempt to repair the nucleus.protein go to the nucleus.
13354	5	-The mRNA can leav the cell. -The cell will take in sugars. -Thei will be convert into energy. -Thei will be us as energi for the cell.
13355	5	The four major step involv in protein synthesi ar when the DNA is be replicated, when rRNA is be produced, when tRNA is be produc and when mRNA is be changed.
13356	5	first you go to prophas then from prophas you go to metaphas from metaphas you go to anaphas from anaphas you go to telephas dure all these step you start offf with two cell then you have the cell seprat into two seprat on then thei just end as be on cell

15765	6	To cross the cell membrane, protein help molecul across. Lypid head on the outer layer and on the inner layer help to secur the cell membrane. Phosphat head help to secur the membran as well, to make sure noth come out or in that isn't suppos to.
15766	6	A concentr gradient is the movement from a bound structur into another, so therefor thi would be on wai cell control movement. Another wai is organelles. Organel all have differ purpos of be in the cell, some mai perform the task on control what come in and out of a cell. Another wai is the Lysosom becaus thei ar the 'digesters' in the cell so thi would export substanc that ar not needed.

15999	6	One process us by cell to control the movement of substanc across the cell membran would be that there is a cell membran which is semi-permeable. Semi-perm mean that onli certain thing can get into the cell. Thi type of membran control the movement of substanc across the cell becaus certain thing cannot get into and then move around in the cell. Another process us by cell would be inform transfer where organel in the cell transport DNA and rNA throughout the cell' system. A third process us by cell is when the lysosom come around and sort of 'clean up' dead organel and recycl them.

16024	6	Osmosis, diffusion, and facilit diffus ar the three process us by cell to control the movement of substanc across the cell membrane. In osmosis, it is the movement from higher concentr to lower concentr across a membrane. The sout ar be dissolv in to the solvent and can readili do so on their own. With thi there ar three type of solutions: hypotonic, hypertonic, and isotonic. In facilit diffusion, it is movement from higher to lower concntrat across the membran as well with ting that can not readili pass through on their own. These then us the help of thing such as sodium potassium pump and ion channels. in diffusion, it is also the movement from higher to lower concentration. These thing do not need assit pass through and can readili do thi own their own unitl thei reach equilibrium, in which all thing ar balanc and even.

16042	6	In order to control movement of substanc cell us cell to cell contact, hormon signals, and membran proteins. Cell to cell is simpli what it sound like. It is a process that result in the contact of two cell that allow substanc movement. In hormon signals, hormon transmit differ signal that allow substanc to move through the membrane. The function of the membran protein is to control what enter the cell and thi allow substanc to enter the cell and move through the membrane.

16053	6	Three proces us by cell to control the movement of substanc across the cell memberan ar diffusion, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Duffus is when the cell split apart into more cells. Endocytosi is when the the the cell need the surround layer to form, and when someth ha to re-ent the cell. For exocytisis, the cell alreadi ha the surround layer for the substanc to move across it, the cell won't let anyth els come in.
16054	6	Each cell is compos of a membran with mani protein that allow substanc to move across, through the portein. Another process is osmosis. The eell must balanc it insid and outside, so it must move water and other substanc across it membran to make everythign equal. The cell diffus other substanc through the membran without us the proteins.
16055	6	Cell us membran pumps, diffusion, and osmosi to control movement across the cell' membrane. Membran pump can help move the substanc with or against their concentr gradiant to get them where thei need to be. Diffus help control what substanc move through the cell membran by try to reach equilibrium. Osmosi control water movement across the cell membrane.

16078	6	One type of process us by cell to control the movement of substanc across the cell membran is facilit diffusion. Thi method requir the us of energi to get larger molecul that cannot regularli diffus across the cell membrane. Another method us by cell to control the movement of substanc across the cell membran is osmosis. Osmosi is the regular diffus of water or other small particl across the cell membran without the us of energy. Cell I don't believ can control the movement of substanc here. Laslti is diffusion. Diffus is the movement of particl again that ar still small enough as if it wa osmosis, but it move differently. These particl move from low-concentr area to high-concentr area of particles.

16082	6	One type of process a cell us to move substanc across the cell membran is facilit diffus which is a type of passiv transport. Another exampl is osmosis. Thi too, is a type of passiv transport. A third exampl of a process in which a substanc is move across the cell membran is the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump transfer 3 sodium ion out of the cell and 2 potassium ion into the cell. The sodium-potassium pump is an exampl of activ transport. One other exampl is diffus which is a type of passiv transport.

16160	6	Cell can us osmosi to control the movement of substanc across the cell membrane. Osmosi is when water difus through a barrier to the other side of it. Diffus also can be us to control the movement of substanc across the cell membrane. Diffus is when a substanc move from an area of higher concentr to an area of lower concentration. Transcript can be used, as well, to control the movement of substanc across the cell membrane. Transcript is when a protein is translat and then move across the cell membrane.
16161	6	ACTIVE TRANSPORTOSMOSIS
16162	6	1. some cell have a flagllum that can make them move around.
16163	6	The cell is surround insid by the cytoplasm. That hold all of the organel together. The second wai is to travel through all the organel on at a time. The final wai is when the substanc is enter or leav the cell through the plasma membrane.
16164	6	The first type of movement that the cell membran us to control the movement of substanc is passiv transport. Thi mean that the substanc be transport will be on the higher side of the concentr gradient and be push across the membran so that both side will be at a state of equilibrium. The second type is activ transport. Thi mean the substanc will be push against the membrane, from be in a less dens to more dens side. Thi take energi from the cell and usual happen at a certain point in the membran where the substanc can bind with a certain type of enzyme.Th third type is osmosis. The cell will have to take in water to maintain it function work properly, and the substanc mai be in the water that the cell take in, allow the substanc to cross the cell membrane.
16165	6	Cell have a select permeanbl membran mean that thei onli let certain thing into them. Thi happen in two ways, osmosi and diffusion. Osmosi is the cross of water through the cell membran and diffus is the cross of other things. One wai that a cell allow thing into it is activ transport. When a cell ha to us activ transport, it ha to do someth to let the object, or liquid, into the cell. It ha to us channel protein to allow it in. Another wai that cell let thing cross through the membran is through passiv transport. Passiv transport is more lai back and happen easier than activ transport.
16166	6	I don't think that that we even did thi but I'll try. Ummm on is the nucleous. The second would be traspertation. The third on would be cell wall.

16297	6	cellular commun cell reproduct
16298	6	Cell us simpl diffus to move substanc across the membrane. Simpl diffus involv substanc (such as water) locat in an area with a high concentr of that substanc to move to a locat with a lower concentr of said substance. For example, if there is a high concentr of water insid the cell, and a lower concentr outsid the cell, then water will pass through the cell' membran and go outsid the cell. Cell also us facillit diffus to move substanc across the cell membrane. Facillit diffus move substanc from an area of lower concentr to an area of higher concentration. Thi type of diffus requir energy. Cell also have special transport protein in their membran that help move larg substanc into and out of the cell. These type of substanc would be too larg to pass through the cell membran just through diffusion.
16299	6	One process that cell us to control the movement of substanc across the cell membrean would be activ transport, anoth is diffus and the last on is osmosis. In activ transport you go from a place of low concentr to high concentr and for the other two you go from high concentrationt to low concentration.

18768	7	One trait that can describ Rose base on the passag is reserved. Although Rose ha a famili that she can share all her feel with, she keep everyt inside, thi can be seen when Aunt Kolab convers with Rose. Aunt Kolab is concern about how Rose feels, and tri to allow her an outlet to her feelings, but Rose doe not sai a word, instead she keep her thought to herself and mere nod her head.
18769	7	Rose is a hardwork girl.Whil talk with her sister she said that as she wa finish her homework, she fell asleep.
18770	7	Rose seem veri honest for exampl when her aunt see that Rose as alot on her mind by the wai she acts. When her aunt ask if it wa a alot to take in she told the truth she didnt try to ignor she just told her yes.

18775	7	One trait that can describ Rose is caring. In the stori Rose ask her younger sister what wa wrong, instead of sai not bother to sai anything.
18776	7	Hard worker. The day, like most of her dai had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restaur to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepar a quick supper. After that it wa time to do homeowork.
18777	7	SHe ha veri bad night mears.
18778	7	Rose is the kind of person who want to help everyon even if it mean hurt hurself. She work all the time and goe to school. She even put off write her paper for the state competition. She doesn't want to hurt her Aunt by sai that it is to difficult for her.
18779	7	I feel she ha the trait of a surviv for in all her problem she find the light. When talk to aunt Kolab and express herself and feel she find it wa an enlight of her help. She also find what to write her paper about
18780	7	Rose is worri becaus she hold out her hand and realiz that her brother fate partli li in her hands.
18781	7	She like to take outsid suggestions. She doesn't alwai have her own ideas.
18782	7	Rose is a veri care and kind heart person. Dure her convers with Anna she tri to explain why their father is work a job in Lo Angele so that Anna isn't so mad or upset. Then when Anna leav the room, Rose follow her to try and explain more, but Anna is alreadi asleep. Rose also had a convers with Aunt Kolab in which the reader can tell that she is care or kind hearted. Her aunt ask Rose if she feel weigh down by what she is have to do to help the family. When her aunt ask thi question, Rose didn't want to answer becaus she didn't want to hurt her aunt feelings. After she realiz that her aunt is sincer in ask thi question, and she will be understand of Rose' response, Rose answer the question.
18783	7	One trait that can describ Rose is responsible. Rose work to help support her famili and take respons in comfort her younger sister Anna by tell her that thei have a part to do to help their family.
18784	7	I think on thing that could have been a trait wa that mayb she wa respect and a good listener. For exampl the author said suddenli it occur to her: here wa her topic so that meant that she listen to her aunt while she talked.
18785	7	She think about what other peopl ar go through and ha feel for them. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go for college.' Also in thi she talk about how she care for monei and get a lot of it.
18786	7	Rose doe not like to show her emotions. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt. And probabl her aunt would tell her mother.
18787	7	Rose is supportive, a trait exemplifi in her convers with Anna. Rose hide her feel in order to explain to Anna the necess of their parents' actions. She doe her best to comfort her sibl and back up her family.
18788	7	1) Rose and Anna- dissagr . Anna glare at Rose. ' Monei isn't Everyth . Anna roll her ey and shove her chair awai from the table. ' You sound just like mama .
18789	7	Dure the stroi Rose fell asleep due to over work herself through out the day. 'I fell asleep work on my essay.' In thi quot it show how she pile on more work onto her alreadi busi day. She stress her self out to try to make herself perfect.
18790	7	Held back, she cant do what she wants. Her aunt ask her if she felt weigh down and she didnt respond so it make me think she wnate to sai yes.
18791	7	Rose is seem to be a veri upset girl, who is unsur of her life and it worth.
18792	7	Rose ha a veri creativ imagination. In the stori Rose dream about swim through clear green tint water and enjoi the pure simplicti of a fish life.

18794	7	She care a lot for everyon and not just herself. 'You sound just like Mama.'
18795	7	You can tell from that she' sincer from how she want to know how Anna wa feel when she wa rub her eyes.
18796	7	She truli care about peopl and she feel sad about her life.
18797	7	Rose alwai think befor she sai things. In the story, she said if she would have told the truth it would have hurt her aunt' feelings, so she didn't sai anything.
18798	7	see is stron and dosent show anna that she is realli upset.
18799	7	'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18800	7	Rose show that she is sympathet when she sai to Anna, 'What' wrong? You feel okay?'
18801	7	Rose is insecur becaus she' not sure when her parent will come back and she' not sure if what her aunt tell her about her life get better is true or not.
18802	7	Aunt Kolab' trait is her try to help Rose.'Hmm. Mayb we can find a wai to do thing differently. A wai better for you.'
18803	7	One trait that describ Rose is respect or nice becaus she doesn't answer her aunt becaus if she told the truth she thought she would hurt her aunt' feelings.
18804	7	Base on the stori Rose seem like a veri care person and that she will do whatev it take to ensur that she help someon get whatev thei want or get anywher that thei want to in life. Rose give up alot, and live her life in the situat that she doe becuas becuas she know that is what' best. In her convers with Anna Rose basicli tell her to keep stick through it and it'll pai off by remind her 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for me and you to go to college.' She see that what she do right now in the present is what is go to get her where she need to go in the future. She' a veri strong, smart person.
18805	7	When Rose wa talk to her sister Anna in the kitchen an she wa mad, Rose kept give her posit feedback. I think that'swhat the oldest child should alwai do. I don't think that' howsh realli felt but that' what Anna need to hear.
18806	7	Rose is respect of her relit feel becaus in paragraph 19 it said she didn't answer becaus if she told the truth it might hurt her aunt feel
18807	7	I think Rose is caring, but she is just too pressur to stai focus and do what she want to do. You know she care by her still try to write a three-thousand-word essay, when she ha school, and a job to concentr on. For her to put that much work in for her famili show she care a lot about them.
18808	7	Rose is overwhelm with work. She feel what her famili is go through and is try to help but is scared. She ha to go to school, then go to work, and on top of that she ha to do homework and help take care of her family.
18809	7	Rose is a posit person who tri and reassur her sister as much as possible. She realli care about her famili and tri to take her respons maturely. We can see thi in her convers with Anna. When Anna is complain about her father go off to work, Rose reassur her by sai that it' onli been 4 months. Then she continu saying, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' We can see that she care about her brother and is posit about the work she must endur to help him succeed.
18810	7	Rose is veri help becaus she tell her sister that thei have to do their part to help their brother.
18811	7	One trait that can best describ rose is she is love
18812	7	I think that rose is worri about her famili and all the other conflict in her life. She is veri awar of everyth that is go on in her life. When she wa talk to Anna she said that her brother had to go and get a job in Lo Angele becasu it paid three time more. She also said that when Paul finish colleg he' go to get a good pai job and that he will pai for thier college.
18813	7	Rose seem positive. She said, 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to college.'
18814	7	Rose is veri hopeful. Internally, she mai have her doubt about all of her family' struggles, but she suppress her worri and doe what she ha to for her family.A good exampl of thi is dure her convers with Anna about how thei have their part to do to help Paul finish colleg so that he can get a good job and pai for them to go to college.
18815	7	Selfish, ' the job at the lo Angele paid three time what he wa make there.'
18816	7	Rose is a help person. In the story, she is alwai try to find a wai to help her family.
18817	7	Rose can be best descirb as caregiv person. I think that she care for her dad and she miss him and want him to come home.I also think she is more like a dai dreamer, she think alot about the past and she like to imagin thing or have flash back of good moments.
18818	7	Anna glare at Rose.'Monei isn't everything.'Aunt said with a puzzl look.'you'r do to help thi family?'
18819	7	care
18820	7	she wa told that she is just like her mom
18821	7	Caring. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18822	7	she work hard for someth that she want like the competit but she doe not forget about her other duti like home work.Th essei prove my point she wa work hard for it yet she still did her work shifts.
18823	7	One trait that can describ Rose base on her convers with Aunt Kolab is that she still ha grow up to do. Even though she ha a lot of respons on her shoulders, she is still young. She still ha a lot of learn ahead of her. Rose need someon to talk to when she ha a conflict in her life. You can see thi trait in the convers with Rose and Aunt Kolab.
18824	7	Rose is strong-heart and head strong. She understand that her situat in life ar difficult right now have to go to work, make supper, go to school, and do homework, but she keep her head up and still believ that everyth will get better in time. She is optimist about a lot of situat such as the convers with her sister Anna.
18825	7	She is a hard worker.
18826	7	One trait of Rose is that she is thought full. An exampl is toward the end of the story, she li to her Aunt so she wouldnt hurt her.
18827	7	Rose is caring. She seem concern when Anna walk in and she ask Anna if she feel okay.
18828	7	She is positive. Even though she is feel the same way, and like she ha to do all the work she still kept a posit attitude. She fake it to make her sister feel better. For exampl she talk about how Paul is go to finish colleg then pai for them to get good jobs. She wa sai that thei wouldn't have to suffer for too long.
18829	7	Rose seem to be a realli stress out kid. The passag support that with mani thing but, I think a realli good exampl of it would be the convers she had with her aunt.
18830	7	She is worri about the respons she ha to take on. Rose felt too young for so much responsibility.
18831	7	I could us mani word to describ thi young Cambodian girl name Rose she' helpful, caring, smart, gracious, and veri resepons but I believ that the word that suit her the most is mature. Rose is veri mature, she is handl her situat quit well, she' not go around and complain about how much she ha on her plate she' try her best to keep a posit view on things. She work a four-hour shift at a restaurant, goe to school and still help out with household chore like help her Aunt Kolab prepar dinner. She' a young adult and ha a veri high level of matur for tackl all her task and be a strong role model for her younger sister Anna that why I would describ rose as mature.
18832	7	Caring; 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probabl her aunt would tell her mother.'
18833	7	Rose seem to be held back by her family, as she express to Aunt Kolab.
18834	7	From the story, you can tell that Rose is a veri heartwarm person. She care about her famili and respect their differ cultur that thei mai have. Rose wa alwai a posit person, even when her and her sister Anna would get into it, she would alwai stai positive.
18835	7	Caring: Rose said 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to college.'
18836	7	Rose is a respons young girl. She is also hard-working. One detail from the stori that support thi assumpt is the follow excerpt: 'From school she'd gone straight home to help aunt Kolab prepar a quick supper. After that it wa time to do homework.'Ros had a lot of respons that she manag without becom complet stress out.
18837	7	Rose doesnt like to hurt peopl feeling. You can tell becaus when her aunt ask if she felt weigh down by what she wa do to help her famili she knew how she felt she just didnt want to tell her aunt the truth becaus she didnt want her to be upset.
18838	7	THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT IN YOUR LIFE..
18839	7	Rose is a veri suddl or respect person becaus she kept some of her feel insid of her or didn't tell anyon how she felt fot a while, and no matter what she wa bound to keep work to keeep her famili good do whatev it took.
18840	7	I can tell from thi passag that Rose is a veri gener person. Throughout the entir passage, she talk about how she is stress out and under much pressure, but she keep do it all to help Paul get through college. A veri specif part to show thi is at the veri begin whenev she wake up from doze off when try to do her homework. After that part she talk about why she is tired: becaus she goe to school, works, and then ha to help around her hous and try to keep up with homework, and she continu do all those thing to help someon else.
18841	7	Their convers were good thei alwai would talk about the good?
18842	7	A trait that could describ Rose base on her convers with Anna is frustrated. I feel thi wai becaus sh is veri upset about the family' situat and the amount of import she is right now in their lives.
18843	7	One trait that Anna ha is the need to pleas people. Anna ha the type of person that everyth need to be fix and correct by her. For example, she place alot of stress upon herself to fix the famili issues, but in the end all that occur is a feel of heavi weight is place on her by her family. (Paragraph 18)

18846	7	In the story, Rose is the main character. Thi main charact displai kindness. It can be easili notic in the convers that she ha with Aunt Kolab. When thei ar talking, Rose suppress her feelings. She is under the impress that she mai offend her aunt, so she doe not mention how she realli feels. These trait show that Rose tri to be kind even when she is under quit a lot of stress.
18847	7	1. Rose is selfless, becaus she is will to do someth for her famili that she doe not want to do, and she doe not want to let Aunt Kolab know how she feels, becaus she think it might hurt her aunt.
18848	7	Thei lost on of there famili member and thei ar upset about it and she keep dream about it and all thei want it to be happi and all thei think about is that famili member that pass away.
18849	7	I think the trait that can be us to describ Rose is she is busi with everyth in school, her job, and help with the house. She wa stire from write her essay.
18850	7	She doe a lot for her family. She defend her father when Anna sai he ha been gone too long. She sai thei all have their own part to do to help their dad finish college. She suggest to her Aunt Kolab that she feel 'weigh down' by what she is do to help her family.
18851	7	In the end, Rose is abl to show her feel and not keep them inside. She is under a lot of stress, and ha a dream about Paul weigh down on her body. She confess to her aunt that it is difficult for her to help the famili out as much as she does. After she talk with her aunt, Rose feel reliev and lighter.
18852	7	Rose could be describ as protective. In her convers with Anna, she insincer laugh after she state that monei isn't everyth 'Only if you alreadi have everything,' in order to hide the depth of the family' struggles, as well as the weight upon her own shoulders, from Anna.
18853	7	Thi stori is discrib that Rose is let her work control her attitude. When she talk to Anna, ignor her sister' bad dream.
18854	7	Considerate, she didnt want to tell her aunt she felt weigh down by the famili becaus she didn't want it to hurt her.
18855	7	that she is deni what is right infront of her but she is will to help and try to make it better
18856	7	One trait that Rose ha is that she is kind becaus in the stori she ask Anna when she walk in her room what the matter.
18857	7	Rose seem to have her own opinion about evereything. 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to colege.
18858	7	Rose is not resentful. Rose and Anna ar talk about their father' job and the monei he is make there. Rose doe not complain about her father' job in Lo Angele that is far awai from the family, while Anna does.
18859	7	Worried. Rose is worri about what will happen to her brother and her sister. She' worri about what will happen if her brother 'sinks'.
18860	7	She is loyal, but cannot live the wai she is expect to. At the begin of the stori she wa upset that she had fallen asleep and fail on of her tasks, thi show that she sincer want to get the task done.
18861	7	When Rose wa talk to Anna she flet kind of like she wa be amused. Then when Anna glare at Rose and said that monei isn't eeryth she wa realli upset when her gradfath went to Lo Angele for a job there.
18862	7	A trait that can describ Rose is that she hold a grudg on her brother. She doesn't think that he will pai her and her famili back for the colleg that he went to.
18863	7	Rose is care toward Anna. When Anna walk in rub her ey wonder about their mom, Rose tri to make her feel better.
18864	7	Conflicted. Rose know that she ha to work at her job and make monei to support Paul at college. Yet, she ha her own dreams, and she ha an essai to write, which she could win a prize for. But she need to keep working, and to accept the prize you need to go to Sacramento, but if she doe her boss will fire her, and she wont be abl to work for support.
18865	7	A trait that Rose ha is she is put under a lot of pressur and is stress easili with her famili conflict and juggl everyth that is occur in her life. He aunt ask her, 'Do you feel so weigh down by what you'r do to help thi family?'. rose is timid and doe not tell her the truth and thi displai that she is stressed.
18866	7	She is independent. I sai thi becaus in the articl she ha to take care of her sister and she alreadi ha a job.
18867	7	Rose is a person who worri about her future. My detail is that she is alwai wor about someth in the future.
18868	7	Rose seem strong in supress her true feel on the situation, and assur Anna that everyth will be okay. She appear to be quit an optimist person.
18869	7	patienc Her littl sister yell at her becaus he doesn't under stand wai everyon is work and no on is home and Rose doesn't get mad or anything.
18870	7	Rose talk to anna in a sencer, love way. ' Anna,' Rose said. 'what' wrong? You feel ok?'
18871	7	A trait would be hope for the better, 'She tri a laugh that sound even fake to her.'
18872	7	When Rose wa talk to Aunt Kolab, she did not speak. It wa almost as if she wa scare or afraid to hurt her Aunt' feelings. She did feel almost exactli how her Aunt wa suggest and she wa to nervou to tell her. When her Aunt offer to help out more by make some special treat or sew for ladies, Rose felt as if a heavi weight wa taken off of her shoulder and she becam less stressed.
18873	7	She doesnt want to listen to what anton ha to sai about what thei have to do to make end meet. In paragraph 11 Rose is tell anna that thei have to help paul finish colledg by workin and in paragraph 12 anna sai u sound just like mamma and storm out of the room.
18874	7	Rose is a charact of mani traits. One that is reveal in her convers with Anna is her compass for do thing thei wai thei should be done. She understand that Paul is in colleg and need help. She also understand that when she get in colleg she will also need help too. Her head is on straight and she can see realiti instead of what she want to see.
18875	7	She think about other peopl than herself. 'Mayb we can find a wai to do ting differently. A better wai for you.'
18876	7	Rose feel sorri for herself becaus he ha so mani thing to do and, to her, her life isn't that great. One detail from the stori is that she ask Ana what wa wrong and when Ana repli Rose ignor what she had to sai and start talk about herself and how she doesn't have time to get her essai done.
18877	7	Rose is care yet she let a lot of thing get to her and she dwell on them but she also tri to make everyth seem better.For example, 'It' onli been four months.' 'He had to go. The job in Lo Angele paid three time what he wa make here.'Also when Rose tri a laugh that even sound fake to her.
18878	7	Rose is a respect person. She seem veri busi with work and school but doe not complain about it. One detail from the stori is that she did not want to hurt her aunt by tell her that she is feel weigh down by help the family.
18879	7	Rose is reliable. She goe to school and then right after goe straight to work for four hours. Right after that she help make dinner and get her homework done. Not veri mani teen can do all that or ar even will to try it.
18880	7	Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18881	7	I think that on trait is that Rose is alwai exhaust and in a grumpi mood
18882	7	A trait to describ her by is good. I sai thi bcuas she want to do thing that help out he aunt.
18883	7	I think that she is kind heart becaus in the stori she tell that she work her job to help out the famili and pai for things.
18884	7	One trait that can describ Rose is when her younger sister walk in rub her eyes. 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What' wrong? You feel okay?' That show that Rose care about her and is veri respectful.
18885	7	Rose is veri stress about help her famili for she feel overwhelmed. But at the same time she doesn't want to tell her Aunt Kolab that she is feel stress becaus she know that Aunt Kolab will most like be hurt by the information. Thi prove that Rose is thoughtful of other people' feel and caring, even when she doesn't feel well herself.
18886	7	rose is a care person becus she sai 'what rong? you feel ok. thi tell that she care for her sister becus she could of not said eni thing and she wouldent know what her sister think about.
18887	7	She is care becaus when her Aunt Kolab ask her question about if she feel weigh down by what she is do to help the famili Rose didn't want to answer becaus she didnt want to hurt her aunt or mother.
18888	7	She need an answer to her question and she want her opinion
18889	7	One trait Rose ha is self absorbition. In her talk with Anna she take in all of the pain that her dad isn't home and tri to keep it awai from Anna.
18890	7	I think Rose' trait is that she ha a lot to do with the family. She tri everyth just to make the famili happy. She is kind of like the mother. She ha quit a bit of responsibility. An exampl from the stori would be when Rose said 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaur to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepar a quick supper.'
18891	7	One trait that can descib Rose is that she is hardworking. The stori sai that she came home from school and went straight to the restaur to work a four hour shift and then straight home to help with supper. She also had to do her homework. Rose wa a hardwork and had dedication. She had to have dedic to do school, work, and help out her family. Rose mai have had to do all these things, but she did her best at all them to help her family, and to make a better life for her and her family.
18892	7	Rose is grow up too fast and have to take on respons that she isn't us to. She ha to act like more of an adult than she realli is so that her sister doesn't have to worry. Thi is obviou when Anna sai 'You sound just like Mama.' It show that even if rose doesn't realiz it, she is becom an adult.
18893	7	One trait the identifi Rose is that she ha alot of fate in believ her famili will hopefulli come out of debt sometim and will not have to worri about monei anymore. An exampl would be when she sai that their dad had to go to Lo Angole for a new job so he could get paid more monei and some dai return, at the same time their brother is go to colleg and onc hi finish and get a good job, their dad and brother will help pai them two to go off to college.
18894	7	She love money.
18895	7	One trait that can describ Rose is trust. She trust her aunt enough to come to her and tell her what wrong and it end up give her motiv help.
18896	7	Rose is a strong induvidual, becaus she doe alot for her famili and stai strong for them. An exampl of thi is in paragraph 11 sentenc 2 and 3. 'She tri a laugh and that even sound fake to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college' Thi show that Rose is try to stai strong for Anna and her famili by support Paul.
18897	7	The trait that I would give to Rose dure her convers with Anna is strength, becaus Rose is also upset about her father be awai for four month but she decid not to get discourag about it.
18898	7	One trait that can describ Rose is open minded. Rose spend the whole time stress about her essai and what she is go to do to support her family. In paragragh 23, Rose becam more open mind when she began talk to Aunt Kolab about thing she could do to be help to the family.
18899	7	Rose is veri responsible, and she want her famili to stai together. Thi is talk about in the stori when she sai That she need to look at thing through other peopl ey also.
18900	7	Rose is care toward her sister. She give her sister Anna a logic explan as to why their father move for work, rather than complain about how much she miss him too. In a wai she is try to comfort her sister and tell her that it is for the greater good of the family.
18901	7	She is caring. She know that Paul need to go to colleg to get a job so that he can pai them back, but Anne just think about it now. Although, Anne is right about monei isn't everything.
18902	7	That she is alwai worri about her school work and noth else. When anna told her thath she had a bad dream all rose did wa chang the subject about the essay.
18903	7	Rose is a care person, and thi becom evid when she ask Anna if she feel okai after Anna ha had a bad dream.
18904	7	help
18905	7	She wasn't veri confid about what wa goo on with the essai and her dad.
18906	7	she is shelfish. she onli thought about herself and money. mayb we can find a wai to do thing diferently, a wai better for you.
18907	7	Hope ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to college.''
18908	7	I think that Rose is sympathet becaus when she wa talk to her Aunt Kolab in the kitchen she doesn't come out and tell her aunt that she feel weight down by what she doe to help the famili becaus she doesn't want to hurt her feelings.
18909	7	Rose is a veri hard-work young woman. As her aunt had ask her, 'Do you feel so weigh down by what you'r do to help thi family?' Poor Rose ha had to work four-hour shift on top of go to school in order to support her brother through colleg so that, in return, he can work and support Rose and her sister come time for them to go to college.
18910	7	thei both dont understand what rose is try to sai
18911	7	stressed- In the 14th paragraph, it sai 'She felt too young for so much responsibility', as she cup her hand togeth think about her life situation.
18912	7	One trait that you could give Rose is that she a hardworker, becaus when she came to the essai and she didn't have anyth to write about. She didn't give up or put it off and not do the essay. She continu to try to find a topic to write about.
18913	7	Rosa is veri motherly. When Anna walk in the room Rosa' first respons is to ask, 'What' wrong? You feel okay?' Thi show how she care for her and her family.
18914	7	After read the text, Anna is present as be ti down, or feel suffocated. She show thi throughout, but she show it when she wonder to herself when she would squeez that essai in(paragraph 3 sentenc 1).
18915	7	she ha too mani emot
18916	7	One trait that can describ Rose base on her convers with Aunt Kolab is that she is hardworking. She is so hardwork that Aunt Kolab notic it. Aunt Kolab sai dure their converst that mayb thei can find a wai that is better for Rose. One that will take so much stress off of her. Thi show that she must work hard for the famili to keep it running. It show that Rose is veri hardworking.
18917	7	Rose' trait displai in the stori is that she is a veri hard worker especi for her family. When she talk about her dai is begin with 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaur to work a four hour shift, then staight home to help Aunt Kelob prepar a quick supper.
18918	7	Rose is care in the wai that she doe not want to troubl other with her own conflicts. Thi is shown when Rose doesn't answer Aunt Kolab when she sai Rose feel weigh down by try help her family.
18919	7	That she is responsible, becaus she help her sister Anna with her bad dream, even though she didn't appreci it.
18920	7	Rose ha a trait of protectiveness. Thi is shown through her convers with Anna when she hide her emot from Anna. Thi is an exampl of protect becaus she is do what is best for her by not show that she is scare as well. Thi will give Anna a sens of comfort to think that someon is in control. Another exampl is when Anna first walk in and the first thing Rose doe is ask if she is ok.
18921	7	Rose is a veri kind person. She ask how her sister feel and goe to her room to check on her.
18922	7	Rose is perseverent. She doesn't give up. She work a four-hour shift after school and ha to do homework too. She know that she ha her famili fate in her hands. She know that she can't give up.
18923	7	AN THE ATHOUR IS RIGHT MONEY DOESNT BUY HAPPYNEST
18924	7	She is extrem care of other and doe all she can for other people.. She also alwai put herself last befor others.
18925	7	Rose ha a trait that make her seem to herself as helpless. Thi is a good trait becaus you can do more work when you have someth that need done although you do not know why. You feel helpless and so you do someth that need done without you realli even know you did it. Rose is talk to Ana at the time that thi trait expos itself. It says, She tri a laugh taht sound fake even to her. Thi is try to get her sister to no feel so bad about Papa leav to go to Lo Angeles. She is also try to get her to know that it is their respons to support Paul through college.
18926	7	Rose is veri stress becaus of thi essay. She just need to take her mind off of the essay. In the end she wasn't think about the essai and her Aunt help her firgur out titl by not realli even help her.
18927	7	Rose is veri determind but she is also be wigh down by other thing like the essai she is do to help her family. She is veri determind to get the essai done and help her famili and her brother.
18928	7	Even though it doesn't sai in the story, but you can kind of get a hint that Rose is older than Anna, but also younger than Paul. Paul is away, so Rose ha to step in and be the matur on and watch after her littl sister. She is mature, becaus in the convers with Anna talk about her father, Rose is try to sooth Anna' thought about miss her dad.
18929	7	If I had to us on trait to describ Rose from thi story, I would sai she is overwhelmed. In thi story, I could tell by her convers with Anna and Aunt Kolab that she felt like she had too much rest on her shoulders. For example, when Aunt Kolab sai '... Thi must be difficult for you. Yes?' and Rose nods.
18930	7	Well Rose is upset becaus of her essai and Anna tri to confort her like ani sister would and Rose is angry.
18931	7	Rose ha forgotten how to care for others, by onli look toward the futur and forget the present. From be over work in the persuit of rais monei for her brother she ha lost sight of her sister and how to care for her. Here in thi passag she directli ignor her sister, ' 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had anoth bad dream.' 'I fell asleep work on my essay,' Rose said' (Paragraph 7 Line 1).
18932	7	Rose is hope that sinc her aunt see it her wai that her life will get better.
18933	7	Her distress defin her as a character. She is worri about what will happen and is feel great pressur from her famili to succe and to contribut to the family. I drew thi from her Aunt' respons to the dream, when she said, 'Do you feel so weigh down by what you'r do to help the family?', a question she did not answer becaus the truth would hurt her aunt.
18934	7	rose tri to anna can understand the real problem with their parent and she is try to do her best to have a good famili by her side but anna just dont get the situation. for exampl rose told anna that her parent need to work more and that thei have to appreci the opportun that thei ar have in their job and anna just dont get that, that a good opportun for her family.
18935	7	Rose can be describ by be stressed. In the stori it state that her brain becam exhaust and is alwai busi move from on activ to another.
18936	7	I feel she is respect becaus she listen patient while the other person is speaking.
18937	7	Rose seem to alwai act like the mother in the hous when her mother work late. She goe to school, ha a job, cook supper for the family, then she doe homework.
18938	7	In the passag Rose is feel weigh down by her famili becaus she ha to work and go to school just to be abl for her famili to live a some what normal life. In her convers with Anna, Anna ha a differ view of the stori becaus she is younger and doesnt have to work she doesnt see the unjust posit that her older sister and he mother ar in. She doesnt understand why their father had to leav for a better pai job. Anna ha a lot of resent toward her famili but she is continu try to surpress her feelings. In Anna and Rose' convers 'Anna glare at Rose. 'Monei isn't everything' 'Only if you alreadi have everything,' Rose said. She tri a laugh that sound fake even to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to college.' Thi reveal that even though Rose love her famili she resent that she ha to help send her brother to school, but she is put on a brave face for her littl sister and sai that even though thei have to work hard it will all get better soon.
18939	7	Rose is composed. She is break under the weight of her essay, her job, and all the stress in her life, yet when Anna come in to talk about her nightmare, Rose is calm and collected. 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had anoth bad dream.' Anna is distract Rose from spend much need time on her essai with a mundan topic, but Rose still speak gentli to her with the compass of a love sister.

18944	7	She is a worri person. She think that she doe not want to have the respons that Paul had and she think that if she tell her aunt, her aunt will be upset.
18945	7	One trait that can describ Rose is that she, though feel extrem weigh down by her mani responsibilites, alwai put the well of her famili as a whole befor her own well being. Thi is shown dure her convers with her sister, Anna. Anna is complain about their father be gone but Rose argu that their father need the far awai job to help pai for Paul's, their older brother, colleg educ so that when he get a job he will help to pai for their education.
18946	7	Rose is a hard worker who work to exhaustion, as can be seen when she says, 'I fell asleep work on my essay,' to Anna.
18947	7	While Rose wa talk to her Aunt Kolab, on trait that I saw wa that her Aunt wa veri supportive. Her Aunt gave Rose a differ point of view of the situt by her sai thei can find a wai to do thing different.

Anna, Roses' sister, is furiou and explain that monei is not everyth in life.Ros disagre and sai that thei have to help Paul get through college, then herself, and Anna.

18955	7	She tell her aunt everyth and is veri trustworthy, but she feel guilti about what happen to her brother. She had the bad dream about her brother but made herself feel better by talk to her aunt.

18967	7	I think that Rose is resent of the fact that her famili is not with her. That Paul need the monei their father is make while in Lo Angele that make him have to be so far awai from the rest of the family. Also that she feel that she ha to help to bring Paul into college.
18968	7	Rose is veri jealou of her brother Paul.
18969	7	Rose is veri consider of other and put other befor herself. Thi wa shown when she talk to both Anna and Aunt Kolab. When she talk to Aunt Kolab she realiz that everyth she wa do for Paul and for the famili wa worth it. She show thi when she says, 'Cambodian tradit and sens of family, she realized, could surviv an ocean crossing.'
18970	7	She is a hard worker. She goe to school, then straight to work, then home to cook, and final doe her homework which just so happen to be a 3000 word essay.
18971	7	She is veri stress by the wieght she ha on her shoulders.
18972	7	Rose is hard-work becaus she weigh herself down with respons for the purpos of support her family.
18973	7	Rose is a type of person that doesn't give up eaisli and fight until she get it all work out. When her and her sister were fight she kept argu until thei came to a conclus and thei both felt thei had won and walk away.
18974	7	In the stori Rose is veri mature. She is try to succe in school, help out around the house, and blanc a job. Although her situat isn't ideal, she perform the same task everyday. I notic her matur when her Aunt ask is she felt weigh down by the family. Rose didn't repli becaus she didn't want to hurt her Aunt. Thi show me that she not onli understand the feel of others, but also understand her famili situation. At her age, thi show maturity.
18975	7	Rose is veri determined. She doe everyth she can to help pai for her brother' college, even though she is exhaust and stressed. In the convers between Rose and Anna in paragraph 11, Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' Thi statement show that Rose know how import it is for her and her sister to stick through the hard time to get the monei for her brother.
18976	7	One trait that can describ Rosa is talented. Talent descrid her dream and yet the fact that she came up with a stori about her dream. It wa also creative, she didn't just pick some idea and settl with it, she put time and effort.
18977	7	One of the trait that Rose ha is careing. Dure the convers with Anna, Rose is ask her what wrong and if she feel okay. She care about her and her family. One other exampl would be when she is talkin to Aunt Kolab she doesnt want to tell her that it too much work for her to handle. She doesnt want to upset them, becaus she care about how thei feel.
18978	7	Rose is a dedic person. While she is talk to Aunt Kolab, she figur out what topic she is go to write her essai about, which show her dedic to get her work done. Rose is also prove to be dedic by work on her essai until she fall asleep and keep up with school and a job.
18979	7	Rose care about how other peopl will feel if she realli tell them how she feels. For exampl when Aunt Kolab ask Rose, 'if she feel wiegh down by what she is do for her family'. Rose' respons is,' if i told the truth, i would hurt my aunt and she might tell mother.
18980	7	Rose felt more hope after talk to her aunt. The stori tell us that her aunt' offer had somehow made her feel lighter.
18981	7	Rose is veri selfish.
18982	7	Rose is a strong individu becaus she hasn't seen her dad in four months.Plu she ha to go to school then right after school she goe to work and after she get off of work she ha to do homework .
18983	7	Unsure is a trait i would us to describ Rose. One exampl is how she if fret andunsur about the essai contest come up, and she' also unsur about her brother is what her dream showed.
18984	7	'I hate how late she ha to work'
18985	7	In the story, Aunt Kolab ask if Rose felt like the famili is wiegh her down. Even though it wa true, she decid not to answer. Thi make me assum that Rose is a veri help and respect person.
18986	7	Rose is a person that tri and do watev she can to help out her family. Like she work at a restuar to help around the house. Rose' mother alwai have to work late.
18987	7	One trait attribut to Rose is a sens of hopelessness. In the dream, she puictur her self collaps under the weight of her responsibilities, and under her brother's.
18988	7	She is veri matur and you can tell becaus she can fell the stress from Paul and know her responsibilities.
18989	7	She ha alwai been so busy.
18990	7	She ha faith in everyth she does, and she care about her sister. I believ it becaus she tell her sister that everyth will work out and that thei will go to colleg like their brother.
18991	7	Rose hide how she realli feel to both of the characters. Thi is on trait that she ha and she show it by not sai what she realli what too.
18992	7	One charact trait that I can identifi about Rose is that she is not veri outspoken due to her convers with Aunt Kolab. She seem like she wa scare to tell her aunt how she relli felt becaus she wa afraid of hurt her aunt' and her mother feelings.
18993	7	Rose is faithful. She is faith becaus she doesn't want to hurt anyon in her family. She doe what she is ask becaus she know it the right thing to do. In the stori the aunt ask 'Do you feel so weigh down by what you'r do to help thin family?' and Rose didn't answer becaus the truth would hurt her aunt and she doesn't want to hurt anyone. Rose is a good person.
18994	7	Rose act like she is resent to her family. When she list all the struggl she went through with her normal day, it sound like she resent have to do what seem like all the work. She goe to school, then to work at a restraunt, then she had to go home and work more to prepar dinner.
18995	7	One trait that can describ Rose is a presistance. Her school dai wa veri long. After school, she went to work and did a long shift, then came home and made supper, and now she wa try to make a three-thounsand word essay. That take someon who is a hard worker and who is persistant.
18996	7	Rose is veri understand in her attempt to calm Anna down. Thi trait is express by the wai she try to explain why Papa is gone. For exampl when Anna start to bring up the fact that Papa ha bein gone for a while, Rose try to help by saying, 'It onli been four months.'
18997	7	Rose is a heard worker like her dad. Her dad took a job in Lo Angels. He doesnt get to see hi famili much
18998	7	In the stori Rose seem to be overworked. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaur to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepar a quick supper. After that it wa tim to do homework.'
18999	7	Rose is obvious veri confused, she ha a great burden to carry, but is confus by what other peopl think of it.
19000	7	Rose is selfless. When Anna came into the kitchen to talk to her after her nightmare, she start talk about how she miss Papa and she wish Mama didn't have to work such late hours. Anna, I'm sure, felt the same way, but she hid her feel becaus she had to make Anna feel better. She had to put her littl sister befor herself.
19001	7	rose respect and care about how other peopl might thin befor she speaks. in the stori she didnt want to tell her aunt someth becaus she didnt want to hurt her feelings.
19002	7	Rose wa a veri hard work girl. She felt realli lone becaus her dad had just left and her mother work most of the day. She said she felt too young for so much responsibility.
19003	7	Detuermined,esh said that thei had to do their part to help paul get thru colleg then he will get a good job and he'll pai for them to go to college.
19004	7	Rose is alwai tire or busy, becaus when Rose wa talk to Anna, Rose said that she fell asleep or she could not get the essai done.
19005	7	One trait that can describ Rose base on her convers with her sister Anna would be she sound like she want to be in charg of her sister Anna. Rose act like a mother figur to Anna. One exampl from the passag would be when Anna roll her ey and shove the chair awai from the tabl and said 'You sound just like mama'.
19006	7	Rose doesn't think she is all to great. In the begin she wa have troubl write an essay. She then tell her sister how she fell asleep while write it and think monei is everything. Then later on she tell her Aunt Kolab of her dream and how much pressur is on her. Rose think she is the underdog in the family.
19007	7	A trait to describ Rose would be stressed. Aunt Kolab said, 'Do you feel so weigh down by what you'r do to help thi family?'. Rose didn't answer becaus if she told the truth, it would hurt her aunt.
19008	7	Rose is mature. We know thi becaus when she talk to Aunt Kolab she doe not want to hurt her Aunt and therefor doe not answer the question about if she feel weigh down.
19009	7	Base on Rose' convers with her Aunt and her sister, Rose is veri matur from the situat she ha alreadi been put in. When Rose come in the kitchen to find her Aunt she confess that it is difficult.
19010	7	She is a kind person but, she is weight down with all that is happen to her and her family. She felt too young for so much responsibility.
19011	7	She is veri responsible. She work at a restaurant, and is a full time school student. She took care of her littl sister when she woke up from a bad dream.
19012	7	Rose ha a charaterist of be veri worrisome. In the convers with her aunt she think to herself if her life will get easier or not.
19013	7	One trait, is when Rose said 'a gentli as she could'. One detail is when she woke up and came downstair and her aunt said, ' Do you feel so weigh down by what you'r do to help thi family?', and Anna didn't reply.
19014	7	One trait that could be us to describ her would be, strong. Strength seem to fit her base on what she is try to do for her famili and try to get a better educ as well.
19015	7	Rose is generous. She doesn't tell about how she realli feel becaus she' concern about everyon else. It is shown in paragraph 18 Aunt Kolab says, 'Do you feel so weigh down by what you'r do for thi family?'. Then in paragraph 19 when the narrat states, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. Thi show that Rose is gener and concern of the well-b of others.
19016	7	Rose is veri quiet. When she wa talk to Aunt Kolab, she just kept nodding. When she wa talk to Anna, she kept chang the subject and suppress how she realli felt about the situation.
19017	7	She is stressed, and seem to be have troubl manag everyth that need to be done, but she is will to do it to help out her family. In her converst with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish College. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to college.' Thi passag show that she is awar of how hard it is now, but all her work will pai off eventually.
19018	7	I would sai that Rose is a sad girl who doesn't alwai know what to do and is try to see if other would help with out make it wors on her or her family. She feel like she is the on that is hold the famili together.
19019	7	Rose is a respons character, in that she help write an essai for her older brother and is still abl to carri that weight with her. She never onc ask somebodi els in the stori to help her.
19020	7	'You sound just like Mama.'
19021	7	That she worri much about her her father. She tri to sai as gentli as she could. In paragraph 14, it sai 'Paul' fate li partli in these, she thought. She felt far too young for so much responsibiltity. then she shivered, imagin how her brother must feel. Only three year older, he held the fate of two people-both hi sisters-in hi hands'. So the trait would be that care about people. her family.
19022	7	Rose respect her Aunt Kolab and in paragrapg 19, she did't want to tell the truth and her Aunt Kolab' feel in some way.
19023	7	Rose is sad. She miss her dad veri much.
19024	7	One trait about Anna, base on thi story, is that she realli want to help her family, but she' feel veri pressured. She think that the fait of the famili is all on her. Thi is shown in the dream she ha in paragraph 15, when she is be held underwat by her oblivi older brother.
19025	7	When rose had woke up and ask anna wa sh eok, then she told her s he had fell asleep on her essai again.
19026	7	Rose is a veri realist person. In the last paragraph from the stori she open up to her aunt a littl to let her know how stress out she is. Her aunt offer other altern to make monei and thi is good for Rose. Although Rose know it a good opprotunity, she doe not get her hope up becaus she know that everyth might not get better for her or her family. Thi show she is realist becaus she ha hope, but she also know the realiti of the situat might not allow thing to be improved.
19027	7	Rose is take in to thougth to what her aunt said to chang her thought that noth would sure work out. 'Mayb her life would get easier. Mayb it wouldn't . But her aunt' offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'
19028	7	Rose is veri senit and realli need her sister help.'You sound just like Mama.'
19029	7	Rose keeo nodding. Mayb her life would get easier. Rose is alwai is busi and alwai forget someth she ha to do until the last minut and try to squeez it into the dai that is alreadi as busi as can be.
19030	7	Rose is thoughtful, from the convers she had with her aunt she take in her family. She want the essai to be so good and didn't want her brother to look bad that it start to weight on her mentially.
19031	7	She ha a posit personality. She sai 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for yo and me to go to college.'
19032	7	When Rose wa talk to Anna she tri to be strong to give Anna some hope. That show that she is sincer and it also show that she is a strong individu that want to help out if she can.
19033	7	Rose is stress out. She ha too mani thing to do right now in her life. She ha to go to school, then work a four-hour shift, then cook supper for her family, and final work on her essay. She feel she is overwork herself so that her famili is supported.
19034	7	Rose is veri consider of those around her. She supress her own feel to make other feel better, as shown in the follow quote: 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' Rose doe not tell her aunt what she is truli feel so as not to upset nor disappoint her aunt.
19035	7	Rose is veri responsible, but need a break or a littl weight lifted. She doe what she is suppos to do.
19036	7	Rose appear veri mature. She attempt to make an explan for her father when Anna come out to talk. She also show matur when she choos to talk about her problem with her Aunt Kolab.
19037	7	One trait that descib Rose base on her convers with Anna is matur becaus she understand what is go on in her hous with the monei sitution. She tri to explain to Anna why her dad is gone for so long.
19038	7	Rose is a pesimist. Rose sai 'even if i win i wont get to travel to sacramento'. She also said ' if we had everything' refer to her dad work awai from home.
19039	7	One trait that can describ Rose base on her convers with her younger sister Anna is that Rose is optimistic. One detail from the stori that can support thi is when she is explain to Anna that Paul, their brother, will get a good job and pai for Anna and Rose to go to college. Rose is displai her sens of optim by talk about the good thing that will happen in the future.
19040	7	Rose is veri matur about her famili problems. The exampl in the would be when she tell Anna 'He had to go. The job in Lo Angele paid three time what he wa make here.' She understand and still miss her father just as much as Anna.
19041	7	Rose seem to have a sens of duty. She sai that 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college.'
19042	7	From thi stori we can infer that Rose is a worri person. She is alwai worri about other peopl and try to be the best. She said she wa worri about get her essai done so she could win. She want to be the best and actual win the contest. Then she wa worri becaus she couldn't make it to Sacremento to claim the prize if she did win. She had taken too much time off and wa on the verg of get fired. That made her worri even more becaus then she would be out of a job.
19043	7	Rose is veri stress out. The stori let me know by sai 'She felt too young for so much responsibility'
19044	7	When she is talk to her sister, and she doe not respond to what Anna had to sai show she is not that care about what other peopl have to say. She is more selfish.
19045	7	that she is sometim willin to listen but somethim not. but when she hear someth she like she get incouraged. she learn how to give and help other out.
19046	7	Rose is a veri care person who tri not to hurt anyone. You know thi by the wai the author state that she tri to tell Anna as gentl as she could that their father had onli been gone for four months. She want tobe free, but rather she would want the happi of her own famili befor hers. Sinc Rose is a care person, mayb that is why she didn't wan to hurt her aunt' feel when thei were have a conversation.
19047	7	Rose seem veri busy, and she ha no time to herself. She said she didn't know when she would squeez in write a flawless three-thousand-word essay.
19048	7	One trait that can descirb Rose base on her convers with Anna is she' loyal to her family. While she wa convers with her sister, she claim that she and Anna have to work hard for their brother. Also, Rose defend her mother and father when Anna complain that they'r both awai working.
19049	7	Rose is hardworking. In the stori it sai ' From school she'd gone straight to the restaur to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepar a quick supper.'
19050	7	She is a good person. She onli want the best for Annna.
19051	7	I think on trait that can describ Rose would be how care and unselfish she is. In the stori Rose says, with her hand cupped, 'Paul fate li partli in these.' She care abut Paul so that is why she tri so hard in everyth she does.
19052	7	Rose is a hard worker. She goe to work at the restaur and still come home to help cook supper. After supper she doe her homework. She also is try to win a three thousand word essai contest.
19053	7	I think Rose is a veri care person. She care about Anna and her parents. She realiz that her dad had to go get that better job to support the family. One detail from the stori is that Rose care about her job and her family. She believ her parent must work to provid for them
19054	7	Rose is a veri determin person becaus of what she doe for her family. Despit all the stress from school and work, she still find time to write an essai for a competit outsid of school. She also exhibit determin in that she doe not tell her younger sister about all her problems, so she doe not make her sister worry.
19055	7	Rose can't help rememb her father sink to the floor.
19056	7	One trait that describ Rose is confused. One thing that support thi is that she doesnt know what she want to do in life when she wa talk to her aunt.
19057	7	Rose is veri understanding. She isn't stubborn about do thing that other American teenag wouldn't ever have to do. She understand that her famili need her help in support her brother, sister, and everyon else. One detail from the stori would be this: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college...' found in paragraph 11, line 2.
19058	7	Rose' younger sister walk in rub her ey becaus Rose wa have a bad dream.
19059	7	Rose is a veri optimist person. When she wa talk to Anna, she wa abl to alwai look on the bright side of their situation. Anna wa name the bad thing that ar go on in their live at the time, and Rose alwai said someth optimistic.
19060	7	Rose is a veri care and understand person, but she feel as thought he famili weight on her is push her down. Her dream would be a good exampl of thi and how it is affect her.
19061	7	Rose see the need to have monei for the family, while her sister would rather not have as much monei and everyon be togeth and at home. Anna doesn't want their father to be in Lo Angele or their mother work so late. Rose, however, explain to her sister, that the monei is need to be abl to live and their brother to be abl to get a colleg educ that would let him get a good job. The good job would then help both Rose and Anna go to college.
19062	7	One trait that wa about Rose wa that she want Papa to go and just come back with the money. It wa all about the money, until she start talk to her sister and then had the dream. That chang it all, her perspect of the whole situat wa total different.
19063	7	Rose is understandig, becaus she understood that her father went awai for a better pai job.
19064	7	One trait that can describ Rose base on her convers with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is veri care of other people. In paragraph 19, sentenc 2, Rose choos not to answer Aunt Kolab' question. If she tell her the truth, Rose know that the statement will hurt her, so she doesn't sai it.
19065	7	Rose is respons in here convers with Anna. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She is help her brother through colleg so she can then go to colleg too. That show a great deal of responsiblity.
19066	7	She listen to other peopl and what thei have to say. When Aunt Kolab is talk to Rose in paragragh 20
19067	7	Rose is try to help her famili get more money. Her Aunt Kolab tri to help her by sai that she will sew for some ladi or make treats.
19068	7	She is Greedi She want someon to leav so that thei could get a job that pai three time more.
19069	7	Rose seem alwai depress and angry. She sai 'mama' not home yet, is she. I hate how late she ha to work.' Her voic sant to a fierc whisper.
19070	7	Rose seem to be a veri care person. She tend to keep her pain bottl up in front of her younger sister, Anna. She doe thi becaus she want to instil hope in her babi sister. Rose know that the situat the famili is in is difficult for Anna to handl be so young. When Anna and Rose ar talk in the kitchen Anna mention miss their father. Although Rose miss her dad deeply, she find a wai to justifi him be gone, again for Anna' sake.
19071	7	A trait that I think that Rose ha is commitment. I think thi becaus she goe to school, works, help with dinner and still doe her homework. It take a lot to do so much through out on dai and her commit to do all of thi is help her and her family.
19072	7	Thei have the same ataitod as each other like when the two sister ar fight in the kitchen.
19073	7	Rose is determined. When she talk to her littl sister Anna, she feel that she need to be brave for Anna and not show her how she realli feels, so she won't worri Anna.
19074	7	She is caring. In paragraph 5 she is consern about her sister and ask her if she' feel okay.
19075	7	She worri about her father so I guess she care deepli about people. In paragraph 14 she sai 'In the dark Pose clasp then cup her hands. Paul' fate le partli in these.' She obvious worri about her father, and in paragraph 8 she worri about her mom have to work so late.
19076	7	Rose is veri selfless. Your hear in the stori about ll of the stress and anxieti in her life in order to help her brother go to colleg but she doen't complain to others. When Rose' Aunt offer to help with the situt and take some stress off of Rose' shoulder Rose doesn't show excit for the relief of all her stress. Rose just polit nodd and think about how mayb her life will becom easier.
19077	7	Rose is respons and understanding. She doe everyth she can to help her famili and doesn't complain about how hard it is on her.
19078	7	Rose is sympathet toward her family. I know thi becaus in Rose' and her and Aunt Kolab' convers Rose didnt answer when her aunt asked, 'Do you feel weigh down by what you'r do to help thi family?' becaus she know if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And her aunt would probabl of told her mother.
19079	7	Rose got help from there aunt. That mean that she got help instead of not do her essay. Her aunt told her that she should do the essai on the Cambodian tradit and sens of family. She also discov that she could surviv an ocean crossing.
19080	7	One trait that Rose ha is hope. Even though her famili is have hard times, she is still hope her and Anna will be abl to go to college. Rose show hope when she says: 'we gave our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he`ll get a good job, Anna, and he`ll pai for you and me to go to college.'
19081	7	Rose is veri dedic to her famili and is will to do what she can to help them.Ros ha a job to help put her brother through colleg and she help her aunt cook dinner when her mother is at work.
19082	7	Guilty; Do you feel so weigh down by what you'r do to help thi family?
19083	7	When Rose clasp her hand together. Pictur the fact that she wa clasp and cup her hand to prove a point.' In the dark Rose clasp then cup her hands.'
19084	7	Rose is thoughtfull. When she wa ask if she felt like she wa be weigh down by have to take a big role in take care for her family, she kind of knod instead of complain about it to her aunt.
19085	7	A trait that can descri Rose base on her convers with both Anna and Aunt Kolab would have to be worri or frantic. Thi is becaus she is worri about her essai and her famili as well, which build a lot of pressur on her. In the end she will eventu snap from all the unnesseccari pressures.
19086	7	Rose seem like the type of person who would worri to much. But at the same time she like to help peopl and she care about other peopl too. For example, Rose ask her sister if she wa okai to see what wa wrong with her.
19087	7	She doesn't like to tell anyon how she is realli feel if it'll end up hurt them. In paragraph 19, she show how she think Aunt Kolab would react if she told how she realli feel about help with the family.
19088	7	One trait that can describ Rose would be hard working. It sai in the second paragragh that Rose had gone to work strait from school, work a four-hour shift, then goe straight home to do homework. I would imagin that Rose would be a veri hard worker know that she ha a job and she is smart in school, and ha the opportun to send a letter in and get sent to Sacramento just to reciev the prize. So in my ey Rose is a veri hard worker.
19089	7	Rose ha mani traits, but on that stand out to me is her will to thrive, and how hard work she is. Rose had long days, but she never stopped. Rose went to school, the straight to a four-hour shift, the straight home to help her Aunt Kolab for dinner, then she work on her home work. She never stop to take time for herself or a social life.
19090	7	Rose is a veri busi person. First, she ha a long exhuast dai of school. After school, she work a four-hour shift. Then she run home and help Aunt Kolab prepar a quick supper. Finally, she ha to do her homework.
19091	7	In her conversations, we can see that Rose is scare to sai how she realli feels. In the stori it sai that 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
19092	7	I would describ her as strong willed, becaus when she is talk with her aunt Kolab she know she is do alot but doesn't complain about it.
19093	7	take thing on herself
19094	7	Rose best charact trait is she stai postiv with other characters. Rose does'nt let other charact know how she realli feel's, becaus she would rather help them. A strong exampl of thi is when Anna is upset about their father be gone. Rose explain to Anna that he is gete valuabl money, so that thei can go to college.
19095	7	Rose is a care person that doe not want to hurt anyone' feelings. You can tell thi because, when she is talk to both her aunt and her sister she tri to down plai her true feel so neither person worri about her. One exampl of thi is when Rose doe not answer her aunt for fear of hurt her.

Then in the second convers she simpli nod agre with her Aunt. Both of these help convei Rose' shy and soft spoken person trait.
19230	7	She suppress her feel until she couldn't keep them insid her ani more. When she talk to Anna, she made everyth sound fine, but she realli miss her father too.
19231	7	In the stori I feel like Rose wa a veri realist person. I think thi becaus when Rose discuss the topic about their father not be around with Anna, Rose knew he wa gone for a reason to help hi famili and she knew that wa how thing had to be to support their family.
19232	7	rose didnt answer becaus she new that tek the truth would hurt her aunt.
19233	7	Considerate, when she wa talk to Aunt Kolab, instead of tell her how she realli felt, she did not sai anyth becaus she knew it would hurt her Aunt' feelings.
19234	7	Rose seem to be veri hardworking. Thi is us in the stori becaus it sai she on a regular dai she goe to school and then ha to work, then she ha to cook dinner, and then do homework. Thi show that she is hard work and take on a lot of responsibilities.
19235	7	She is a care person not want to upset ani body.
19236	7	Rosa show that she care about her famili by help them in time of need. Rosa carri much respons includ work a four hour shift everi dai to make extra monei to suppos her family. Other than that Rosa ha other oblig as a student and child but set them asid so her famili can reli on her.
19237	7	She is worri about other peopl feelings. when anna woke from a dream, rose ask her what wa wrong and pour her a glass of orang juice. and when she wa talk to her aunt, she didnt want to hurt her feel
19238	7	Rose is worri that she won't get the essai done. She states,' When would she squeez in write a flawless three-thosand-word essay?' Thi make me think she' worri about get it done.
19239	7	She is a respons girl, base on the part where she is talk about help her brother pai for colleg so that he can help when she goe to college.
19240	7	Rose is a veri matur girl.
19241	7	Rose is a girl who realli care about her famili and if someth need to be done she will do it. In her convers with Aunt Kolab, Aunt Kolab ask if rose feel weigh down and becaus Rose didnt want to hurt her aunt and felt like it wa her job she did not tell her aunt the truth. Show that she care for her famili and she will do what need to be done.
19242	7	Rose is a respectful being. She is worri about how her sister, Anna, is feel when she walk in rub her eyes.
19243	7	Rose' character, I believe, can be sum up in a short few sentenc between her and her sister Anna. In paragraph 10, sentenc 2, Anna state that in her opinion, 'Monei isn't everything.' Rose' feel toward thi statement ar quit obviou with her respons in paragraph 11, sentenc 1: 'Only if you alreadi have everything.' Here, we can interpret from her words, that Anna feel money, especi in her family' case, is quit important. She feel that monei usual is veri important, unless you have everyth else. In thi sentence, we can see a glimps of how Rose feel about the depend of monei when it come to the outcom of her and her sister' futures.
19244	7	Rose is confused. You can see thi when her aunt says, 'Thi must be difficult for you.'
19245	7	She doesnt like to hurt peopl feelings, she vent to her sister and when her aunt come home she she ask her what wrong but she doesnt answer she doesnt want to hurt her aunt feelings. In the stori her aunt ask 'Do you feel so weight down by what you'r do to help thi family'? she doesnt answer, she know what she want to sai will hurt her aunt feelings.
19246	7	Rose is relyabl when she tell Anna that thei have to help Paul finish college.
19247	7	Dure her convers with her Aunt Kolab, Anna is veri quiet and is not sure about what to sai to her aunt about how she realli feels. Aunt Kolab tell rose to close her ey and try to pictur her own life through the ey of anoth person who is deal with a similar situation. Rose' Aunt want rose to realiz that no matter how hard her life mai seem at ani time, there alwai go to be a littl light at the end of the darkest tunnel that Rose will face. All Aunt Kolab want to do is find the easiest wai to make Anna feel better about her conflict. She want her to know that even if it seem hard to get passed, there will alwai be a wai to get around it.
19248	7	She is a veri busi person, she hardli ever ha time to do anyth while she at school, working, or help her aunt with supper.
19249	7	hardworkingfrom school shed gone straight to the restaur to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepar a quick supper after that it wa time to do homework
19250	7	If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. Rose did not want to hurt her aunt or her mother to find out so she did not answer her.
19251	7	How she still ha some hope left after all that been done through out her life. When she' talk to Anna about thier father she know thing ar bad but for her sister' sake she ha to be strong and believ thing will get better.
19252	7	Hopeful. Rose kept nodding. Mayb her life would get easier.
19253	7	Rose, when speak to Aunt Kolab, show a great deal of respect. I know thi becaus when her aunt ask her about be weigh down, Rose didn't want to sai her real answer becaus it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her mother feelings. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' As you can see in thi qout from the passage, thi support my conclusion.
19254	7	Rose is like a mother, alwai worri and try to act older than she should. When Rose and Anna were talk about college, 'And he'll pai for you and me to go to college.'Anna said she 'sound just like mama.'
19255	7	Well, Rose seem like a veri hard work young women, by have school, a job, and come home to help her aunt make a quick supper. Also after all of that, do her homework. paragraph one.
19256	7	Rose trust that her brother will graduat colleg and pai for Rose and Anna' college. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to college.'

19258	7	In Rose' convers with Anna and Aunt Kolab Rose come off as selfless, is not worri about herself, but about her brother, and put him through colleg so she and her sister can go to college, but at the same time she is try to comfort her sister and assur her that everyth that the famili is for the best. It is for Anna and Rose' future. Thi is shown when Anna and Rose ar speak of how their parent ar work so hard thei hardli get to spend time with their family, but Rose tell her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to college.' Thi passag show how Rose is selfless, comfort her sister, even when she is drow under the pressur she is under, so her famili ha a better future.
19259	7	One trait that can descriv Rose base on her convers with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she think about other peopl feelings. One exampl from the stori that support that she think about other peopl feel is when she is talk to her Aunt Kolab in paragraph 19 when she said 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
19260	7	In her convers with Anna, Rose can be describ as be a matern figur for Anna. Rose tri to calm Anna after her bad dream, and not tell her how she realli feel about the situat their famili wa in.
19261	7	A trait that describ Rose is she care about her famili and their feelings. A detail from the stori that support my answer is when Anna is talk with her aunt she doe not want to tell her aunt the truth becaus she is afraid it will hurt her feelings.
19262	7	Rose is support of her famlii becaus she see the job that her dad took in Lo Angele as an opportun for more monei to support the family, she sai that her dad did the right thing dure her convers with Anna
19263	7	Rose is veri dedic to her family. She work hard and get all her school work done in order to support her brother while he is go to college.
19264	7	She' a dreamer. She had a dream.
19265	7	Rose is a veri care person. She care for her famili dearly. She onli want what' best for her family. Rose unlik Anna understand that you have to make sacrific for a better life. So though it might be hard now. It will later be better for her and her family.
19266	7	I think that Rose is veri give and want to help her brother and her famili but is stress about it. I also think she realiz it will get better and in the end she will have help from everyon in her family, just as thei ar help her brother. Like she said to her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll find a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to college.'
19267	7	Rose is veri sentimental. She take on the role of be Anna' mom when their real mom isn't there. After Rose realiz that Anna is veri upset whie walk in to the room, Rose immediatli ask Anna what is wrong and tri to comfort her.
19268	7	Responsable. She told her sister that thei had to do what thei were do so there brother could graduat collag and help them get to collage.
19269	7	Exausted, I think thi is a great trait to decrib Anna becaus she is exaust with have to work and go to school in order to support her famili in the best wai she can. One exampl from the passag is when she ha her is talk to her Aunt Kolab, and she ask her if she feel wieght down. She doesn't repli to try not to make her Aunt feel disappoint with her.
19270	7	She is caring. She ask her sister what is wrong and if she is feel okay.
19271	7	One trait that can describ Rose would be that she is determined. Rose goe to school regularli and also ha a job. She also help around at home with whatev need to be done. Rose doe not give up on thing that ar import to her or her family. Even when thing ar difficult and she doe not feel like she ha enough time to finish, she still put all her effort into get the job done. She feel over work at times, and occasion ha doubts, but she work through them and continu on.
19272	7	She is feel veri respons becaus it show to everyon in the famili
19273	7	Rose tell her aunt how busi and stress she is. Rose tell how her problem relat to her dream.
19274	7	She is a veri hard work girl. In the stori it state that sh goe to school, from school she goe straight to work, from work she come home and make supper for the family, and barlei ha time for school work.
19275	7	Rose' convers with Anna show that she will not give up at anything. It also show that she ha wai to mani thing to do in a day. She also show that she trueli doe care about other but she juse doesn't know how to show it.
19276	7	She worri for her famili . She pour Anna orang juic and comfort her with how her fater is respons with paul go to college. When paul got a job he would soon be respons to send hi sister off to college.
19277	7	One trait that I believ describ Rose is lonely. I believ she is lone becaus no on understand the wai she is feeling. For example, when Anna and Rose were talk Anna didn't care about what Rose wa tell her. Anna roll her ey and left the room.
19278	7	She try to help other peopl out howev she can, she show thi becaus she is help paul finish college.
19279	7	'I fell asleep work on my essay,' Rose said.I think thi mean that Rose is a busi person and tri to push herself to do mani thing in her dai and get tire often.
19280	7	Rose is a conflict character. She feel weigh down by all she ha to do to help her famili and herself. She ha to help pai for her brother educ and ha to work on her educ too. 'In the dark Rose clasp her hands. Paul' fate li partli in these, she thought.'
19281	7	Anna care about her famili veri much. Her sister and her don't alwai get along but thei will try to work thing out. It said that she roll her eyes, push her chair awai from the table, stoodup and stalk out of the kitchen is a good wai to explain that thei don'talwai get along
19282	7	Rose care about her family. She see her sister and the first word out of her mouth are, 'Anna, what' wrong? You feel okay?'
19283	7	Rose is an outgo person. Even though Anna is upset that her father had to leav and her mother is work late Rose tri to make it seem better by sai that their father pai is be tripled.
19284	7	One trait that can describ Anna would be motivation. Anna ha a lot of motiv to help her family. She doesn't want to see her famili struggl so she doe everyth she can to help out like earn monei by work at a restaurant. A detail form the stori that support my answer would be when she sai 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
19285	7	I believ Rose is veri grate about thing in her life. Even though she feel stress and pressur to make it easier for everyon els she doesn't tell her Aunt Kolab. She know it' kind of her job to be that way. It defin show when her aunt ask her if she feel weigh down and it sai 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probabl her aunt would tell her mother.
19286	7	She wa scare to tell her ant the truth so she ask her a question instead of just come out with what she need to say. So I can sai that she is lonesom or doe not trust ani on with her feelings. it show thi in paragragh 19
19287	7	Rose is a hard work girl. She get up to go to school and when school get out she goe to work and work a four hour shift. Then goe home to help Aunt Kolab fix a quick supper then she off to do her homework. Rose try her hardest at everyth she doe to help her family.
19288	7	In the story, Rose stated, 'I'm insane,' in paragraph 3. The impress that I get from her is that she is overwhelm with things. It seem as if she is in a hopeless state of mind. Peopl expect her to do her best, and she believ that peopl think too highli of her. But toward the end of the story, her emot chang when her and her aunt ar have a conversation. In paragraph 23, it states, 'Mayb her life will get better.' Now she is in a hope state of mind. Rose seem to be the type of person that is easili influenc and let' thing get to her at times.
19289	7	Rose seem to be an encourager. You can tell thi by how she tri to encourag her littl sister, even though she felt discourag herself.
19290	7	Rose is hopeful. Rose said 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pai for you and me to go to college.'
19291	7	Rose is a realist, who doe not hold onto dreams. She believ that noth is easy, and she know the truth. For exampl when Rose and Anna ar discuss their father and hi take a job far away. Rose explain he had no other choice, that hi job wa the best decis for the family.
19292	7	Accord to the text on trait of Anna' would be that she realli care about her family. It goe to show in the text the convers between Rose and Aunt Kolab. Rose feel weigh down by the famili becaus her dad depart to Lo Angele to take a job and her mother alwai work late. In Rose' dream of her brother jump in the water on top of her show that she is too worri to relax. Aunt Kolab even ask Rose if she feel weigh down by what she is do to help her famili and Rose doesn't answer but, she know that how she feels.
19293	7	One trait that can describ Rose base on her convers with Anna and Aunt Kolab is that she is care doesn't want to make anybodi feel bad becaus of her struggles. She want to comfort everybodi and make them feel as good as she possibl can. A support detail of thi is when she Aunt Kolab ask her if she felt weigh down by all of the work she had to do and she wouldn't answer becaus she didn't want to make her aunt feel bad.

Base on these details, it is obviou Rose is a love person who put her famili first.

19304	7	Rose is a veri hard work young ladi and the reason I sai that is becaus she' go to school, work to help out with the family, go home and help make supper with her aunt, and then do her homework.

22277	8	Paul see that he is be coach by a great athlet who had mani successes. That had to have made paul feel that he wa go to get better becaus hi coach had experience.
22278	8	Mr. Leonard embodi the onc great, old mentor cliche. Becaus Paul is unawar of Mr. Leonard' past, and is us to follow hi orders, Paul is will to try the thing Mr. Leonard confront him with. As state in paragraph one, the last sentence, 'everyon complied.' No on question Mr. Leonard, and therefor hi past wa never questioned. When Mr. Leonard becom empathet toward Paul, it chang things. When you becom us to someone, it becom easier to question and learn about them. Paragraph eight foreshadow thi relationship when it sai the Mr. Leonard' 'gaze softened' toward Paul. Not know about Mr. Leonard realli ha as much effect in the earli stage of their acquaint as much as later learn chang their relationship. When the coach write out a web address and tell Paul, 'Visit thi site. Do a search for 'Grabowski,'' it preclud the notion that Mr. Leonard' life wa dull and without bother for question. Rather, it chang the accept lack of knowledg to a pursuit of mystery.

22284	8	The effect thi ha on paul is a postiv effect. He see that Mr. Leonard wa veri success in someth and he help him becom success in it as well, without tell him about hi achievments. Paul ask Mr. Lenord why he never share thi inform with him, thi be a touchi subject. When Paul see that Mr. Leonard actual lost hi scholarship due to grade it show the import of a good education.
22285	8	The background inform help Paul understand that Mr.Leonard wa in the same situat that he is in high school. Mr.Leonard couldnt read but he wa good as an athlet just as Paul is. Paul decid to help Mr.Leonard learn to read.
22286	8	Paul doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard flunk out of colleg becaus he thought that you had to be smart to there. He wa also curiou becaus if he couldn't get through high school on hi own how did he expect to make it through college.
22287	8	The background of Mr.Leonard is veri similiar to paul's, when you find out that Mr.Leonard can not read just like Paul, but Mr.Leonard did not have the resourc that paul does. In the end after Mr.Leonard help Paul succe at track, Paul us hi resourc to help Mr.Leonard.
22288	8	HE LEARNED THE COACH COULDNT READ ANS HE WAS GOOD AT TRACK.
22289	8	I think the backgorund inform ha a big impact on Paul. One reason I think thi is becaus sinc Paul found out more about Mr. Leonard it realli encourag him to go for what he want and not let anyth stand in hi way. Even if Paul would ever fail on someth he would have Mr. Leonard right there tell him to get right back up and try again.
22290	8	Paul realiz why Mr. leonard ha been help him, and help him to understand better what hi reason were.
22291	8	Be known as the hall monitor, without a secondari or primari source. For Paul, there would have been no possibl wai for him to have known Mr. Leonard as a hurdler. It' easier to see him as an everyday, averag person as he seem than a famou record break champion in hi youth with the averag job he has.
22292	8	it encourag to know about hi tutor.
22293	8	The inform make Paul curiou as to why Mr. Leonard hadn't told him that information. The next dai Pual ask Mr. Leonard about the paper he had print off. Mr. Leonard tell him about it.
22294	8	That he get into troubl and that he get talk to about it.
22295	8	Learn that Mr. Leonard broke hurdl record in colleg made Paul curiou about him. Paul confront Mr. Leonard about it becaus he want the teacher to explain it. Thi realiz also help Paul understand that Mr. Leonard ha been coach him becaus he want Paul to succe where he didn't.
22296	8	The informatin Paul reciv aabout Mr. Leeonard make Paul feel better. Paul dont feel alon for not be abl to read good becaus Mr. Leonard didn't do good in school either.
22297	8	it explain hi life as a teacher.
22298	8	Paul know almost exactli what Mr. Leonard is go through. Thei couldn't read but in Pauls' case, he ha a class he goe to twice a week that help him learn to read better. Mr. Leonard didn't want Paul to end up like him but he felt that he had a connect with Paul. Thi whole time that Mr. Leonard had been tell him 'On your way' he had been train hi mind and bodi to react to what Mr. Leonard says. When Leonard took him out to the track and said 'On your way' he wa readi to listen. He automat respond to it by sai 'ye sir'. When Paul had found out what Leonard wa all about from when he went to the coach, he wa astonished. He confront Mr. Leonard and ask him why he didn't tell him. Mr. Leonard explain the whole situat to him. From that point on he understood what he had to do. He got as much help as possibl and in the mean time got help for Mr. Leonard.
22299	8	Paul discov that Mr. Leonard fail out of colleg and lost hi athlet scholarship becaus he couldn't read. Thi caus Paul to sympath with Mr. Leonard, becaus he know how the man feels. Thei ar both embarass becaus of their inabl to read, so thei both help each other. Mr. Leonard help Paul improv hi athletic through track, and Paul begin to teach Mr. Leonard to read. Paul also realiz that he is not alone, and that when anoth person help you, you can also benefit them.
22300	8	Mr. Leonard' background imform effect Paul becaus when Mr. Leonard wa young he flunk out of colleg becaus he said no on want atrack runner who could not read. Mr. Leonard is alo embarass to admit he had flunk out of college. Thi ha an effect on Paul becaus Paul is not so good at read and is embarras to go to a learn center for tutoring. Thi is why Mr. Leonard' background effect Paul and Paul' motivation.
22301	8	When Paul find out that the man who wa coach him at hurdl wa a colleg star who broke nation records, he feel a littl confus and more honor to be taught by someon like this. Support detail that Paul wa confus could be when he brought up the page he print off from the websit where he discov Mr. Leonard' past. Mr. Leonard didn't seem too enthus by it, but Paul continu to pry and find out what happened. Once he knew, Paul then felt empathet toward Mr. Leonard, sinc thei share the same problem.
22302	8	The effect of the background inform that Paul found on Mr. Leonard wa that he won the 400 meter hurdl at the nationals, becaus of this, Paul realiz how import it is to learn and not give up in school. I feel that be in track will make Paul a better student and he will recogn how import learn is to make it through college.
22303	8	After all of hi train with Mr. Leonard, POaul get fairli good at jump hurdles. So good that he get ask to practic with the highschool track team. After tell the coach about who he had been train with, the coach gave Paul a URL to the school track website. Paul discov that Mr. Leonard wa a track runner when he wa in school, a veri good one,. he won prize and broke records. Paul wa confus as to why Mr. Leonard hadn't mention thi to him before, so the ask him. Mr. Leonard share that he had been an excel athlete, but not a good enough student, he wasn't given the opportun or resourc in school to improve, so even though he wa so good he wa offer a scholarship, he couldn't do the work and flunk out of college. He wa obviosli embarrased, and didn't want to discourag Paul, becaus Paul had natur talent.
22304	8	The background inform that Paul reciev just sort of give him an inspir to continu try hi best. He learn from Mr. Leonard the import of studi and make good grades. For example, Mr. Leonard flunk out of colleg becaus of hi poor grades. Thi point prove that without good grade Paul will basic go no where and end up be a hall monitor.
22305	8	The narrat inform the reader that the coach wa a colleg athlet that won the 400 meter hurdl in nationals, witch mean the coach ha plenti of exper of run the track. That inform help the narrat reliz that he is learn from on of the best, and that he know if he stick to run he can do alot even if hi grade ar bellow averag or that he not a good reader.
22306	8	The effect of the background info on Paul is that he realiz he is not alone.

22308	8	Paul is deepli move becaus he can relat with Mr. Leonard about not be abl to read. Paul want to help him learn how to read sinc he is be taught at the learn center himself. Mr. Leonard never had the opportun to learn when he wa younger. He is also surpris that Mr. Leonard never told him about hi track success in college. Paul see that he is a modest person who doesn't flaunt hi gift and talents.
22309	8	The background inform on Mr. Leonard that Paul found out effect Paul becaus both have read problems. Mr. Leanoard state 'I wa a good athlete, but not a good student.' Mr. Leonard ha taught Paul to becom a good athlet as of right now Paul can't read veri good. Mr. Leonard had the problem of not be abl to read well like Paul ha now.
22310	8	He feel empahi for Mr. Leonard. He know how it feel to not do well when it come to school. Paul feel embbarrass when he ha o ead aloud or doesn't know an answer everyon els knows.
22311	8	The effect of the back ground inform is that paul want to know more bout Mr. Leonard life. After paul look on the web site from the coach, he find out that Mr. Leonard wa a track person when he wa in high school. Later find out he cant read.
22312	8	Paul get the inform about Mr. Leonard from the high school track coach, and not from Mr. Leonard himself. Paul is a littl disappoint the next dai that he did not get the inform directli from Mr. Leonard. Paul ask Mr. Leonard about hi colleg career, and he explain that he wa a great runner, but did not do well in the classroom. Thi make Paul understand why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about hi track career, and Paul feel he need to help Mr. Leonard as he help him.
22313	8	Paul is confus as to why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about hi background information. Then he realiz that just becaus someon cannot read doe not mean that thei cannot do anyth els in life.
22314	8	After get the informaton about Mr. Leonard, Paul reliez that even though he cant read he shouldn't not that hold him back.
22315	8	I think it gave Paul confid becaus Mr.Leonard wa not a good student like him, but whent on to do amaz thing in colag and set mani records, I also motivet Paul to keep up hi studi and us trake and a outlit from stress and school and to be abl to fit in more.
22316	8	It effect paul becaus leonard can't read either just like paul, but leonard teach paul that a hurdl is just like life and you can over come it and do good in your future.

22320	8	The background inform Paul got about Mr.Lenoard effect him becaus he knew someon who wa veri good at track wa teach him. When Mr.Leoard told Paul he couldnt read and he flunk out of colleg becaus he couldnt read it made Paul want to work hard. Paul help Mr.Leonard read.
22321	8	The background help us understand the stori more.
22322	8	The background inform about Mr. Leonard that Paul is effect by is that Mr. Leonard isn't the best reader ever and Paul wa go to the Learn Center for read help. Paul thought Mr. Leonard had gone to college. Paul had then found out that Mr. Leonard wa a track runner and not a veri good student in school. That had effect Paul.
22323	8	The inform that paul get on Mr. Leonard is a big part of the effect that he ha on Paul. Paul realiz that thei relat to eachoth alot and that it make sens why Mr. Leonard is be so help to him. Thei share the same emot , as Paul sai the feel of embarass when approach with not be abl to read, thei ar on in the same.
22324	8	The effect of the background inform ha on Paul is that is show him that Mr. Leonard wa just like him. He find out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either. Mr. Leonard sai in the stori that he couldn't read, but back then there were no remdial read programs. He also flunk out of colleg becaus of it, but the inform show Paul that Mr. Leonard is just try to give thi kid the help he couldn't get when he wa in that situation.

22327	8	The effect that the background inform the narrat ha on Paul is he wa a great runner but he lost all of hi thing such as hi scholarship becaus hi grade were not good enough for the colleg he wa accept to.

22329	8	The effect that the background inform ha on Paul is that Mr. Leonard told him the colleg scout told him that hi grade didn't matter, that he would have tutor to help him, but also that he thought colleg is a whole lot harder than high school. He went on to sai that he lost hi scholarship and flunk out of high school. He mention that no other school want a runner who couldn't read. The effect wa that Paul felt bad for him but he felt the same way, so there wasn't much of an effect. If there wa ani effect, it wa emotionally.
22330	8	When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard broke record in colleg but then didn't finish college, made him confused. When Mr. Leanard told Paul that the reason he couldn't finish colleg becaus he didn't take school seriously, Paul wa surpris and knew that if he follow hi dream and work hard at school and life, he could accomplish anything. Sinc Paul had the privileg to work hard in school and do a sport that he work hard to be good at, he would do anyth to succeed. Mr. Leonard believ that Paul had potential.
22331	8	The background inform about Mr. Leonard seem to help Paul to try harder to strive for excellence. He is first a littl suspici when he is stop and ask where he is go and why he is go to the Learn center. He soon start to be coach by Mr. Leondard and form a better relationship with him. Paul grew realli suspici when Mr. Leonard ask Paul hi name even though he check Paul' hall pass twice a week. Then the track coach told him to do a search for Grabowski on the internet. He final realiz who Mr. Leonardd realli was.
22332	8	Paul find out that Mr. Leonard also had a read dissabl in school. The first clue that hint thi is when Mr. Leonard ask Paul what hi name is. Paul then wonder why he would ask that when he had seen hi hall pass for dai straight. Once paul find out about the dissabl that Mr. Leonard has, he then becom encourag and tell him that thei need to start train Mr. Leonard for track. Thi whole situat ha a veri posit affect on Paul.

One mai also notic that as time goe on and after the narrat or Paul, reciev the URL, that he find not onli help Paul but wa also a famou runner. He had broken mani record and wa veri fast at running. After Paul ask Mr. Leonard why he had not choosen to tell Paul about hi famou ascubuidy, he discov that Mr. Leonard had flunk out and that he could not read. Paul instead of feel disapiontment, on mai feel that he gain respect for Mr. Leonard. I believ thi to be true becaus in thi articl Paul sai this, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It time to start your training.'
22335	8	Paul wa a track star in high school and colleh but he had a problem. He did not amk good grade so there for he wa kick off the team and also out of college. There for hi track dai were over.
22336	8	The background inform that Paul receiv give him more confid becaus there is a grown man who went through the same thing he wa go through. When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read but still went to colleg show that there wa hope for him even though Mr. Leonard flunk out. He knew that if he push and work hard at learn to read and with track, he could go to colleg as well.
22337	8	Mr. Leonard did not learn how to read well when in high school, so when he found Paul go to the learn center he felt the empathi to help him and train him, 'The emot in Mr. Leonard' voic were all too familiar to me. I knew them well- feel of embarass when I wa call upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyon els knew.
22338	8	It impress him to see how good Mr. Leonard us to be. Thi also confues him, becuas he doesn't understand why he didn't tell him about hi colleg successes.
22339	8	Toward the end of the stori Paul discov that Mr. Leonard wa a veri good track star and that he even broke records. When Mr. Leonard later reveal hi stori about how he alwai got by in life, thi spark a light in Paul' head. He then reliz that he to wa turn out to be just like Mr. Leonard the onli differ is the Paul wa make step to fix the problem. At the end of the passag Paul make Mr. Leonard follow him as he take him on a journei to reading.

22341	8	Paul read that Mr. Leonard wa a great track and when he ask Mr. Leonard about it he sai that he lost hi scolarship and flunk out. Paul can relate, becaus he sai he' on of the 'select few in the remedi read program.' He feel empathet for Mr. Leonard and want to help him learn to read, and mayb help him get some of hi confid back.
22342	8	It realli inspir him it show him that Mr. Leonard know what he is talk about. But is concern at the fact that he doesnt know how to read so sens Mr. Leonard help Paul with sport he is goin to teach him how to read.
22343	8	paul wa a good kid in school. he wa on of the select student in the remedi read program
22344	8	When Paul find out about Mr. Leonard' past, hi attitud chang toward Mr. Leonard. Paul begin to trust Mr. Leonard more, and is more will to listen to hi coach advice. It also make Paul feel less alone, to know that he isn't the onli person to have read problems. Mr. Leonard' stori encourag Paul to do the best he can in school, and to not give up on hi dreams.
22345	8	'Thing were differ back then''.Th colleg scout told him that hi grade didn't matter.
22346	8	I think there is no effect on Paul becaus he wa just do a background check on someone.
22347	8	The backgorund inform is realli import in thi story, or it would realli have never ended. The backgorund inform came from the track coach, just curiou to see if Paul would actual check it out. He did, and found out that the gui that wa help him wa a real athlete, but onc Paul talk to him, Paul realiz that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he did. He couldn't read.

The author end with a conclus that wrap up the articl nice and emphasis the import of the topic.
24787	9	The author organ the aritcl by explain what space junk is with the section, 'What is Space Junk?'. He then show what can happen when satellit crash into each other with the section, 'Crash Course'. He show how littl bit of debri ar bad by the section, 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal'.
24788	9	The author ha put titl of name abov each section, so it is easier to remember.
24789	9	The author organ hi articl into differ points, so the reader can get factual evid of what happen and predictions. For fact he put in that in 1957, the Soviet Union Launch the first artifici satellite. and for predict he state that space trash is increas and more peopl will have to deal with thi problem.
24790	9	The author organ thi articl by start off with background information, to sai what can happen if the space junk doe collid with anoth sattelite, to sai how space debri is a huge threat and can creat a huge problem.
24791	9	At first he describ what the matter is then talk about how that thing that ar still in orbit that ar non us ar in the wai and then describ how all that stuff can caus damag to the spacecraft that is launched.
24792	9	the arthor organ the piec by get more seriou as it goe on. start off with the introduction, then give history. then, tell about the collis and tell how it harmfull.
24793	9	The author organ the articl by give an introduct with person anecdotes. The author then follow with three other section that contain import inform and fact about space junk.
24794	9	The author give detail abot what is space junk is. And how the junk is realli dangrou to the spacecraft. How the gover is concern about the space junk. And the author how it littl bit of stuff had it is a big deal.

24798	9	The author organ the articl by stare out with startl statement about space junk and then give inform about space and our travel to space. Then the author talk about the problem with space travel. The the author talk about the thing that happen while in space and what happen to the austronaut that go up into space.
24799	9	The author organ the articl by the wai the section go with each other. 'What Is Space Junk' can be connect to 'Crash Course', becaus the tini thing that float abov the atmospher can be consid space junk and can still be on a crash cours of something. 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal' can be connect to both other sections, becaus thei all have to do with the danger of small or larg object float through space and becom a danger to the spacecraft and the astronaut on or in the spacecraft.
24800	9	The author organ thi articl in differ section full of information. He inform us on the harm effect of Space Junk, and also provid inform about the past involv space explor and how thi 'Space Junk' ha found itself beyond Earth' atmosphere.
24801	9	The author organ the articl into multipl section base on subtopic. There is the introduction, then 'What Is Space Junk', a section about the origin and natur of space junk, then there is 'crash course' a section about sattelit collis creat microdebri and finally, 'littl bits, but a big deal' about the effect of space junk.
24802	9	the author organiz the inform in the wai that help us to understand the inform better and still get the point across. when he us titl that ar veri explaintori it show us in a good way.
24803	9	The author ha a subtitl That sai 'What Is Space Junk' then the author get to the point of their topic.
24804	9	The author organ hi paragraph in specif sections. First he ha an introduct which captur the reader' attention. Then he wrote 'what is space junk?' which is a section that give a histori of space travel. After that is the 'Crash Course' which explain the crash of satellit into debris. Finally, is the 'Littl bits, Big deal.' and thi is a section about the imporatnc of what he wrote about.
24805	9	The author put everyth in order from lift off to the end of the space craft.

He describ what constitut space junk in thi section of the article. The author then inform the reader that space junk can collide, and provid danger to the peopl on Earth as well. He describ thi in 'Crash Course.' He describ microdebri in 'Littl Bits, But A Big Deal.' He final conclud in a pessimist manner, state that space junk is actual increasing.
24807	9	The author in my opion did organ it well becaus he ha date show when someth happen and the author stai on topic with each paragraph that wa written.
24808	9	Well I hink with how she set up her inform on space travel and on how harm microdebri realli is.
24809	9	The author organ thi articl as if he is veri seriou about the matter and want to put all the concern about space junk in the story.
24810	9	The author us mani differ style of writing. One of them includ hi organization. The author us a differ style of organ than other authors. He doesn't write in chronolog order. He mostli organ from what' least import to the veri import information. The author start with a shock statement, then goe on to explain hi statement and tell hi reader what space junk is. He then talk about the effect space junk can have on other object in space. And in the end he realli start to talk about what peopl think about space junk and how danger it is. The author start with littl information; he is defin what space junk is. And then the author gradual start talk about what space junk doe and it importance.
24811	9	He organ it by put what ha to be with what in each catorgorie.
24812	9	The author organ the the articl by strting the articl with an eyeopener. 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky ! it' a comet! It' a meteor!' 'It' a . . . tool bag ? The next thing the author doe is explain the
24813	9	The articl start out in a comic tone to get the reader' attent and to make the articl seem more interesing. It later goe on to provid specif fact and detail about the serious and danger of'spac junk'. He provid fact about past space explor project and satellit that have crash into each other while move at high speeds, creat a larg amount of tini microdebris. Using such fact he tri to get the reader to see the serious in the matter of 'space junk'. In hi conclusion, he state that the amount of space trash is on the rise becaus more countri have undertaken space exploration.
24814	9	The author organ the articl by catch our attion by have a startl fact about thing up in space. Then he gave us the background of thing that happen in space that had to do with space junk. After that he talk about the speed of junk and how harm it realli is to our planet if thei crash. Then final he talk about how big of an impact outter space junk ha on our saftei here on Earth.
24815	9	The author combin there the stori into sections. The introduct is us to grasp the reader. the next section defin what space junk is. The next section give exampl of it happening. The last section refer to it be a big deal.
24816	9	He start out with a hook to get the reader' attent about the paragraph us sever differ sentences. He then state the gener idea of the whole paragraph which is that mani peopl ar concern about 'space junk.' He then goe on to explain exactli what 'space junk' is in the next section. In the follow section he explain how mani piec of small debri ar creat when satellit crash into each other or when astronaut accident lose a tool bag. He then goe on to tell about what harm effect 'space junk' can have. He then conclud the articl by state hi first idea again and state that mani organ ar try to do someth about the problem.
24817	9	The author organ thi peic into differ section to help the reader better understand the import of space debris. For exampl the author separ the passag into four differ section with titl at the begin to help the reader better understand it.
24818	9	The author organ the articl in a veri logic way, on that is the order a person would think when told the problem. The author start out with a hook that is a refer to a veri well known line which then make the reader want to read more and find out what the author is talk about. The next thing that the author doe is introduc the topic and explain what it is. Then the problem is state along with the reason why it is a problem and what caus it.
24819	9	The author organ the articl by importance. The author tell you about space junk, what it is, how it got there, and how we can help.
24820	9	The author organ it from the begin of the problem then get to how we can solv the problem. It start with give histori of when human first made it to space. Secondli it tell how we have travel through space. Lastli it explain how we could solv the problem of space junk.
24821	9	First, the author give a good AGS(Attention Grab Statement). Then, the authour talk about how orbit pathwai ar now clutter with the remain of numer space explor and satellit missions. Next, the author state his/her thesi statement. Also, he/sh explain to us what is space junk and give us fact about hi topic. Then, he/sh have headlin and explain to us what that headlin means.
24822	9	The author organ the articl by give veri realist detail and by explain thing more clear by provid evid in hi story.
24823	9	The author organ the articl by introduc the topic, give an exampl of when it could occur, and exlpain the effect of the situation. The first section just explain the topic of the article. The second section give and exampl of when space junk wa form and what happened. The third section just explain what happen when space junk is form and how is effect differ thing in the universe.
24824	9	He organ the articl by subject. For example, 'Crash Course' describ the collis of an American and Russian satellit and a toolbag lost in space. and, 'What is Space Junk' describ how debri from satellit in space is created.
24825	9	Throughout the articl you come across mani titiles. Thi is a wai to break each topic down to becom more specfic. With each titl the author ha a cathi phars to go with it, so at frist glanc you think that the topic in minor or unimportant, but you ar wrong. the author organ it from hi to recent occur so show that it ha been a problem for some tinm now.
24826	9	The 'junk' in space is veri harm to earth surfac becaus if a metorit come and crash into earth that is becus of all the trash in space.
24827	9	The tool bag ar the bast wai to do it in space.
24828	9	The author organ the articl by put the topic about the paragraphs.
24829	9	The author organ the articl by let you know what thei ar talk about but without give details, than thei give a paragraph titl 'What is space junk?' thei than tell you what thei ar talk about in detail. After you find out what 'space Junk' is than thei tell you stori of actual event that have happen in our space. With the titl 'Littl bits, But a Big Deal'in part of the articl is let you know just becaus someth is small and harmless when you get that go the speed of 'five mile per second' than you can caus some seriou damage.
24830	9	The author organ it chronolog then factually. It begin talk about space travel in 1957 then talk about more spanc explor in 2009. Afterwards, the articl talk microbedri and more about broken satillites.
24831	9	The author break the articl into four sections. The first section is the introduction. In thi section the author give the audienc a brief idea of what the articl is about also draw the reader in with, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It' a comet! It' a meteor! It' a . . . tool bag?' In the next section, 'What Is Space Junk?' the author tell the audienc about how space explor start and the variou object that have been realeas into our solar system that ar consid space junk. In the next section, 'Crash Course' the author describ how old satelitt that ar no longer be control can crash into each other and creat microdebris. In the last section, 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal', the author explain how thi microdebri travel ar high speed and can still do damag to space ship and astronaut even though the microdebri is veri little. Using thi method the author is abl to explain the harm of space junk to the audienc in the simplest method.
24832	9	The author organ the ariticl by us bold face header at the beging of the differ sections. The header ar What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Littl Bits, but a Big Deal.
24833	9	The author basic organ thi articl into four main sections. First, there is the introduction. Next is a littl bit of histori on how these thing form. After that it talk about the neg affect these piec of debri can have. Lastly, it talk about what organ ar do to try and clean up thi space mess.
24834	9	The author first open with an introduct that grab your attention. He then explain how sinc the start of space explor year ago, debri ha been caught in space orbit from event such as rocket launch and satellit collisions. He talk about differ wai that it can make it into orbits, and also the size of the debri and the speed at which it travels. He then heavili emphass the import and serious of the matter, talk about how danger the fragment can be. He conclud with the belief that enough public concern for the build-up of space trash will caus space agenc to begin look for a solution.
24835	9	He first explain what space junk is and where it come from. Then he tell you more fact about it.
24836	9	he tell what space junk does. then he give exampl to explain.
24837	9	The author organ the articl with first give us an intrest statement and then introduc the term 'space junk.' Next the author explain just what space junk is and the harm effect it can have. The author then back hi claim by give exampl from histori of previou satellit and other object that have pose danger to astronauts. Then the author close with explain that ani size of space junk is a potenti danger and list a few more exampl from the past that have occour and what is be done to help the effort.
24838	9	The author break it down into three small section make it easier to understand.
24839	9	Thei start out by grabe your attent with have you get activ by look in the the sky to see mayb a comet then after that thei sai it a tool bag. Thi then kinda ha your mind wonder why is there a tool bag out there and how did it get out there? After that thei proce to tell you about all the stuff that can be put into space that can be veri harmful.

Also in each section it can contain multipl paragraphs, although still speak roughli about the same idea. Such as in Paragraph 6 and 7 of, Crash Course. These paragraph both talk about dead satelites, except paragraph six talk about collis and paragraph seven talk about the crash and it effect on the astronaut and their ships.
24845	9	He organ it by first explain what space junk is, and than go into detail everyth that happen to satellit and space craft if thei happen to hit, or get hit by space junk.
24846	9	He first tell us about the histori of space stellites. Then it goe to how older satellit have crash and ar now danger to astronats, and how thei can avoid those dangers.
24847	9	The author organ the articl from gener to specific, as the articl progress the inform becom more specif and more detailed.
24848	9	That space junk is bad.
24849	9	The author organ the articl by first catch your attent with the introduction. Then the author begin to tell you about some histori about sattelites. Next the author explain that space junk make a crash cours for spacecraft. Final the author conclud hi or her articl by explain how small debri can caus major damag on spacecraft.
24850	9	The auther organ thi articl in an outlin form, give hi thesis, 3 topic (What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Littl bits, But a Big Deal) and detail within the three topics.
24851	9	The author us a few techniqu with the organ of thi article. In the intro paragraph, humor matter wa us to grab the reader' attention. Thi person also us subtitl for the paragraph in the articl to organ his/her idea and keep everyth in a good flow.

24853	9	The author of the articl 'Orbite Junk', organ the aticl into subsect base of the specif natur of the inform that follows. The sunhead for the section 'What Is Space Junk', give some background inform on past space launch but focus on the debri left behind when the mission fail live so call 'space junk'. 'Crash Course' describ the collis that can occur in outer space. Lastly, 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal' describ just how big of a deal the microdebri is in outer space. At the speed these particl ar move at, thei becom a hazard to all in their vecinity. The us of these subsect allow the reader to better understand and follow the articl 'Orbite Junk'.
24854	9	He give good detail.
24855	9	He start off with a shock and then gose on how space junk began.
24856	9	First the author talk about see a tool bag in the sky. Than the author give background histori of space junk. Than he or she explain why it is a big deal.
24857	9	tehi start by talkin about space junk and how it got there.Next thei talk about how satellit could crash to earth and last thei talk about even if the junk is small it can still do damage.

24863	9	The author organ the articl by simpli talk about space and how there ar satilt crashes. Then thei tell stori about how satilt and toolbag ar left up there. Thei end thi articl about how it a big deal and it dangerous.
24864	9	He organ it by first start off with a bit of humor in the first coupl of paragraphs. But by paragraph 4, the author begin to take a more seriou and inform role. He start of by defin space junk, then lead into the caus of space junk by tell the main caus of it (satellit crashes), and then final inform us of the danger of the piec left over from these collisions.
24865	9	The author organ the articl base on how thing ar rated. Another wai thei ar organ is how thei interfear with the satalight.

24867	9	He start it out with a veri interest introduct that catch the reader eye. The author then goe on to explain all the fact about what can happen with space junk. It is then explain what space junk is and what it can do to space ships.
24868	9	The author organ the articl into differ topics, to put out specif detail that ar important. The differ topic answer questoin instead of have everyth run together. In the paragraph 'What Is space Junk', it tell you when thei launch the first artifici satellite. These differ topic give you import inform and is seper to make us understand easier.
24869	9	'the author organ the articl by put it into section explain each individu statement or fact be collected.' He tell about 'Space Junk,' and 'how satelit can react or how it becom cluttered.'
24870	9	The author organ the articl by put differ topic within the articl that emphas on a certain area of relation. For examples, the section titl 'What Is Space Junk?' focus on the explan of what space junk actual is and how it is created, and the section titl 'Crash Course' focus on the crash between a Russian and an American satellit in Februari of 2009, and goe on to explain that satellit crash ar not the onli sourc of space junk.

24874	9	The author organ the articl by split the inform up into differnt sections.
24875	9	The author start with an interest statment to catch the reader attention. Then, after grab the reader, the author give inform about space debri and differ exampl of problem astronaut and scientist have run into.
24876	9	The author organ the articl by first get the reader interest in the article, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It' a comet! It' a meteor!' Then the author decrib how 'Space Junk' is and created, 'The object themselves, however. ar posit hundr of mile abov Earth far from elemsnt that would caus them to degrad or burn up.' Follow by some effect the 'space junk' ha had, 'Two commun satellites, on American and on Russian, both travel at more than 20,000 mil per hour crash into each other 491 mile abov the Earth.' Then the author close the articl by get the reader to think about how the 'space junk' could be handled, 'Scientist ar hard-press for an easi solut to the problem of space junk.'
24877	9	He orginaz the articl in order from what everyth is to how it work and what happen with it.
24878	9	The author organ the articl into section to help the reader to better understand what the author' point is. The auther us 'What is Space Junk?' to explain what the trash in space is. He/sh us 'Crash Course' to give detail on how space trash is made. Also, he/sh us 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal' to show how space trash is veri danger to astronaut and satellites.
24879	9	By place diffrent titl in the article. Also by give reason and support inform base on the titles. Like Space Junk provid inform about the junk in space.
24880	9	The author organ thi articl by separ differ topics. The author first us a small paragraph to catch the reader ey to get them to want to continu to read the article. One of the first topic provid background inform on what the articl is go to be about and what the problem be face is. The next topic be present is about what ha happen becaus of the problem. The last section of inform state what will happen if the rise problem is not fixed.
24881	9	Thi author organ the articl by make head and describ what each head is about.
24882	9	The author organ the articl by break it up into sections. Each section deal with some differ about 'space junk'
24883	9	The author organ the articl in an effici way. He/sh begin the articl with a phrase similar to what on ha heard at least onc in their lifetime. He/sh make it easier to relat to and it simplifi a veri complex event. The author then discuss the tool bag with a few brief paragraph about the histori of spacecraft. One brief exampl is that he/sh state that in 2009 on Russian and on American commun satellit collid into each other caus numer piec of the satellit to begin orbit earth onc more. After explain what 'space junk' is and the histori of space junk, he/sh then discuss how to deal with it and what peopl ar do to help obtain thi recent ordeal for futur gener of space travel. Again, he organ thi articl effici and effect to where it wa incred simpl to understand and identifi with.
24884	9	The author organ thi articl by give a passag a titl which indic the main idea of that passage, then give detail and proof of the idea the author is try to get across.

24886	9	The author organ the articl by littl import to great importance. I think thi becaus of the us of trash and junk in thi passage.
24887	9	The articl begin in a catchi tone to grasp the reader attent and allow the reader to ask question that will soon be answered. What Is Space Junk provid a beif histori that aid in explain how all thi float space junk got realeas into Earth' swhirl orbits. Now that the austhor ha explain how and why the machineri came into space, the author provid specif situat like the crash of American and Russian stalit to state how the main issu of potenti damage. Lastley, the author rais awar of damag space junk by state the effect of fly microdebri that could damag expens space craft.
24888	9	The author organ thi articl by brake up the inform quit well! Hi open is right on the monei by grap attent to make peopl want to read this. Then slowli he start to give basic inform about satellit and spacecraft from later years. After he goe on about the past he draw in some new inform about the concern about the space junk and how it is affect Earth in mani ways! The author organ thi articl veri well, and made it easier to read.
24889	9	That we need to take care about all the thing that ar around me like space it realli impot to everyon in the earth.

24891	9	The author organ thi articl into question and answer format. By ask the question he get your attent and then goe on by answer it with support detail. By ask 'What Is Space Junk?' he tell you what your about to read about. He then goe on give detail to to the question, give you more information.
24892	9	The author organ the articl by us head for each section to show the reader what each passag will elaborate. In the section 'Crash Course', the reader is given inform on differ satellit collisions. In 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal', the author examplifi why small piec of broken satellit pose a big problem for fully-funct satellites. The reader is abl to us hi knowledg from 'Crash Course' to comprehend the inform given in 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal.' The organ is logical, with each section build on the previou one.
24893	9	He tell about how space garbag is dangerous. About Satellit and why Space garbag is import to people.
24894	9	The author organ the articl by explain the topic with the titles. The author ha Orbite Junk, in the section in onli tell about, orbit pathwai and the in space.
24895	9	Thi articl is organ in sections. The author doe thi so it is easier to read and is easier to find information. The author ha the articl in section of 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal'. The headlin in thi articl give the reader an idea of what the follow papraghaph will talk about. In each of the section the author give histor inform to support the head and the topic. In 'What Is Space Junk', the author explain how 'the Soviet Union launch the first artificail satellite'. The author goe on to describ how thi had an impact and how thi relat back to 'What Is Space Junk'.
24896	9	sp thei csn get tinto the book
24897	9	The author organ the articl by supper into into certain sections. And in each section the author talk about on specfic topic. Thi wai you know what he is explaining. Thi style of writ is help and easi to follow.
24898	9	He organ from when the first launch wa made. Then he put that Unite state launch their next after Russia launch theirs. Next thei put when the satellit crash togeth and made million piec fly in space and some come down and hitting.
24899	9	Thei ask what is junk, and tell you that it stuff from the soler system. then thei tell you haw it got here. Then thei tell you who care about it and what peopl will actual do to get it.
24900	9	He organ it bui the process in which thing take place.

The amount of space trash is increas becaus commer space travel is on the rise and more nation have undertaken space exploration.
25015	9	The author organ thi articl in sections. Each section ha relat inform pertain to it' title. For example, the section titl 'What Is Space Junk?' contain inform about the variou type of debri that ar fly wildli through orbit and how thei got there. Another exampl is the section titl 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal.' In thi section, the author explain that regardless of size, space debri can caus unpresid damag to spacecrafts.
25016	9	The author organ thi articl in that, the author divid the stori into differ sections. For example, the author divid the stori into 3 sections, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal'. By divid the story, it help the reader understand the differ topic that the author is tell you.
25017	9	Well ha start by tell what he is write abot then he go' into how it will effect space travil and mani other things.
25018	9	The author organ thi articl into sections. You start with the introduction, then there is 'What Is Space Junk?','Crash Course', and 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal.' Thi make it easier to sort the information, and to find a certain type of imform faster and with greater ease.
25019	9	He tell you from start to finish all you need to know about space junk, sattellites, and where thei came from. he sai about the import of space collisions, and thei can crash anytim into anoth satellite.
25020	9	It goe from definition, other inform about satellit and them crashing. Such as the titl of each segment in thi article.
25021	9	The author give straight fact and try to keep it intrist by decrib the import of space junk. Like IN 1957, the Soviet Union lainch the first satellite, the US soon after also launch a satellite.
25022	9	The author tri to get your attent an start explain thing from hi observation. He Goe into explain about what is the space junk, and how everyth get out there.
25023	9	The author goe from the not so bad things, to the thing that ar more danger to our atmosphere.
25024	9	He organ it into small sections. Each with their own main point and support details. All come togeth as a full article.
25025	9	He organ the articl into to differ section about space junk. He start off with an introduction. He then explain what space junk actual is. Next, he write about the collis of space junk in outer space. After that he discuss why even if it is in small pieces, space junk can caus big problems. He finish the articl by write about solut to the space junk problem.
25026	9	The auther start out with an interest statment 'Grab your telescope!look up in the sky! It a comet It a Meteor It a... tool bag?'thi reali grab your atinchon and mack you want to read more in to the article. then the author go righit in to exsplan what Space junk is and the author even give a good back stori to how space junk got started. the author then goe on to tell of the searyo danger that thi junk poases. in the wai the author lae out thi articl it provid an oran and thoutfal layout fore the reader.
25027	9	The author kept it organ becaus he put it in good order so thei can get the reader attendion.

25029	9	First he us an introduct to grab the reader' attention. The paus in the question realli doe just this. Then he tell about space junk and what space junk is in the section called, What Is Space Junk? He then tell about collis that have happen includ the on in Februari 2009 that he stated. Finally, he end it up with statement show that space junk is a big deal and need to be fixed. He give a comparison about dust in wind with the sandblaster. He tell how NASA and other maintain catalogu of known objects. He end with tell that the problem is increas and need to be stopped.
25030	9	The author organ thi articl by open it with a attent getter to get the attent of readers. Then the author goe on and explain what he is talk about.

And he close it with a fact to help the reader understand the caus of the problem.
25031	9	The author organ the articl by introduc space junk, he doe thi by tell the histori of space junk. Then he goe on and tell the reader about the risk of space junk. Then he sai how a littl piec of sapc junk can be a big deal.
25032	9	The author organ the write pretti well. He make it understand for the reader to read it. He out hi write in cronalog order.
25033	9	By label what he is go to talk about befor he talk about it.
25034	9	He tell us about space history, for exampl the race between the American and the Soviet Union, and the space junk that wa put into space. He then tell us about the danger these pose and the difiiculti of gete ride of them. He final by tell us how thi problum is increas and the hope that the nation will take more mesur to fix the problum.
25035	9	The main point of the articl is about orbit object but the autor broke it down into three main parts. The first part is describ that 'space junk' is part of orbit satellit and thing that ar no longer functioning. The second part is to show that it is possibl for satellit to collid caus even more 'space junk'. The third part is to show how thi 'space junk' mai not seem like a big deal, but it is and peopl ar begin to increas space explor to look for answers.
25036	9	Thei start with the big thing that ar in space like a varieti of spacecreafts, and then move to thing like microdebris.
25037	9	The author start by gain your attention. Make a question statement that urg you to read on. He then begin to explain the histori of space travel in the section titl 'What Is Space Junk?' He then slowli move on exaplin the danger of space junk. He doe it in a polit yet demand manner. Show that it is an import problem. He put it into threee section to make it easier to explain what space junk is and then explain the problem of it.
25038	9	Thei orgain it by explain what space junk can and will do if you ar not cautiou about thing that can be left up there. Thei also answer ani question that a reader mai have at the begin of each section so you can understand it better.
25039	9	The author organ the articl by introduc new idea and then explain them. In the first paragraph he or she introduc the word 'space junk'. In the follow paragraph the author explain what space junk is and also tell how these object circl the globe in an uncontrol orbit. The next section tell how these object in an uncontrol orbit ar dangerous.
25040	9	The author organ the articl with subtitles. He ha all the separ inform group into section with label state what thei ar about. The introduct is more exciting, and then 'What IS Space Junk' is more formal.
25041	9	In hi introduct he tri to grab the reader attention. After that he state the fact about thi seriou problem. Next he rap up hi stori and tri to tell the reader that thi problem is get worse, but peopl ar involv to help stop thi seriou problem.
25042	9	The articl organ the articl by facts. He/Sh us certain fact about 'space junk' in a specif order that made sence.
25043	9	The author start with interest materi to import fact and conclusions.
25044	9	The author put everyth in diffrent catogori and titl everi category.
25045	9	He organisz it veri neatli and had plenti of research in hi thoery. Enough to make me understand more about it.
25046	9	The author organ the articl into how the space junk get into space. Then, how the space junk can be danger becaus at fast speed it can be veri harmful. Next, the author talk about how even though some of the bit ar veri small, that is bad becaus then thei can not be detect on a radar. The author the talk about how scientist ar try to find wai to get rid of space junk.
25047	9	The author organ the articl in four differ ways. First, the author start with extrem exclamitori statement to get you interst in the first paragraph. Second, the author give you a histori on the great space invasion, then the import of space junk. Third, the author explain crash cours and the magnitud of crash in space. Lastely, he conclud what he ha explain in the first three wai of discript and wrap up the article.
25048	9	On my own opinion I think the author organ the articl well by start with rhetor question and thi gain attent to the reader and also the wai he arrang hi paragraph by describ how the great space invas and continu hi articl by give the causes, reasons, how,effect and conclus thi make the articl organ good and proffesional.
25049	9	The author organ the articl from the introduction, which is veri enthusiastic, to pull in hi reader. Then he give you a brief histori on the matter he is talk about. Then to the matter itsself. Final to how import thi matter is to him and our earth.
25050	9	He titl each paragraph, the explain in good detail on why the junk in space is dangerous. It also catch the reader ey and make them want to read more and more of it.
25051	9	thei explor the vast reach of our solar system, monitor atmospher conditions, and make global wirel commun possible.
25052	9	in the passag the author us titles, to organ the article. The us of titl alow for differ materi to be seper from each other, and to group the alik material.
25053	9	The author organ the articl with multipl sections. Each section describ the problem of space junk a littl more to the reader. The section titl 'What IS Space Junk?' explain that space junk is the debri in spacv that ar orbit Earth, such as broken space capsules, telescop and satellites. The section call 'Crash Course' explain that sometim these object crash into eachother. Becaus these object can be travel at speed of more than 20,000 mile per hour thei break into hundr of piec that each assum their own orbitu path. The last section call 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal' describ how big of a problem space junk is. Becaus these debri ar travel so quickli thei can damag the most carefulli design spacecraft. It also tell the reader that the amount of space junk is increas creat more of a problem.
25054	9	The author organ thi articl veri well. He start off by get the reader' attent with rhetor questions. Then he continu by explain what space junk is exactly. After that he tell the reader what can happen when satellit ar sent up to space. Finally, the author finish by tell the reader how much of an impact thi actual has.
25055	9	Th author organ thi articl into sections. Each section further explain the issu or give background information. The author give inform on satel and object that can get lost in space and the effect it ha on space travel.
25056	9	The author organ the articl by tell you what space junk wa and the wai it occurs.
25057	9	The author doe a veri good job by organ hi article. He start off in the introduct as a light tone, but than get more serious. Thi draw the reader in, and keep the reader occupies. The wai the author order the articl occupi the reader mind.
25058	9	The author organ the articl by explain what space junk is, what happen to the junk, and last how much damag thei can do.
25059	9	The articl first explain what space junk is, then how it get there, next how dangou it can be, and how it can get worse.
25060	9	thei explain the import of space dabri an how it can effect the satellit orbit the earth. the littlest fragment can caus a big problem.
25061	9	First the author introduc what space junk is. Then next the author tell about two satellit crash in the section crash course. Then the author end with the section, Littl Bits, But a Big Deal.
25062	9	The author first organ the articl with the introduction. Then into the second paragraph describ the detail in the introduct paragraph. The third give fact and intrest detail to inform peopl about the sever of space debris.
25063	9	The author organ the inform in a wai in which the reader can understand the complex topic. First by give inform about the first satellit and object were sent into space. Second by give detail about how space junk come to be.
25064	9	The author organ the articl by differ categories, such as: What Is Space Junk? and Crash Course. Thi make it easier for the reader to read and identifi what thei ar go to read.
25065	9	Well first he get you in to it by the first paragraph than hi tone chang . It is organ preeti well. Thei got the paragraph space junk that a interest paragraph the aithor try to bring you in thi story.
25066	9	The author organ thi articl by start with an attent grabber that make you think because, at first it make no since. He then goe on to explain it start with a stori about how the problem start to end with why it is import to fix it.
25067	9	The author organ the articl in a differ way. The author put the articl in three differ section or chapters.
25068	9	He ha titl and then talk about what the titl was. Thei also built off each other. Such as he talk about space junk then some of the wai some of it ha gotten to space and what it doe up there.
25069	9	The author organ the articl in a wai to help explain the problem of space junk thouroughli and make it easier to understand. The author start by grab your attent sai to look at the sky and see a tool bag (paragraph 1 and 2). The author then start to explain the histori of space junk and how 'the human race' great space invasion' start it all (paragraph 4). Next, the differ thing that becom space junk ar explain by state how 'the disabl object becom a piec of high-tech junk, circl the globe in uncontrol orbit (paragraph 5). The author also show the danger of space junk by sai that 'bit of space debri present a veri seriou problem' becaus 'tini fragment travel at a speed of five mile per second can inflict seriou damag on the the most carefulli design spacecraft' (paragraph 9). Finally, the author tell how agenc ar look for 'an easi solut to the problem of space junk'. Thi end the articl by emphas the import of thi problem.
25070	9	The author organ the articl by differ sections. He ha a topic then talk about the topic and doe not get off subject.
25071	9	It list thing in how thei think it should be.
25072	9	He make he to were he can under stand how and what junk is and how bad it is.
25073	9	by creat sever articl support the main idea.
25074	9	The author organ the articl into four sections. The first section, 'Orbite Junk,' act as an introduct that hook the reader interest, make them want to read more about space debri and how it occurs. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?' goe into detail about what 'space junk' is and how all that wast come to settl into our orbit in the first place. The next section, 'Crash Course,' explain the danger of dead satellit in the atmospher and how thei ar at risk for collisions.Th last section, 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal,' relat back all the inform about 'space junk' back to the reader, explain it' signifig and why the reader should care.
25075	9	The author start out with an excit yet almost comic opener. It wasn't someth i expected, but obvious someth i need to know, sinc it is current a concern to govern space agencies. The second paragraph begin by give us some background on what exactli thi space junk is. It tell us that there ar object posit hundr of mile abov Earth and some of them circl the planet indefinitely. Now, onc thi piec of high-teck space object 'dies' it becom on more piec of junk ad to space, which make a problem becaus now it circl the globe in an uncontrol manner. Then it lead us into the crash cours section explain the now dead satellit have the risk of crash into on another. The effect of that happen now caus the problem of tini littl piec of debri float around all throughout space. But those piec ar not the onli debri that roam the atmosphere, ani object that ar releas into space becom free-orbit satellites. So ar astronaut have to be veri caution while in space to be sure noth is left out in the open. The last topic the author touch on is how littl thing propos a bigger problem. Those littl piec ar fly around at five mile per second! That is pretti danger becaus when we send our spacemen up there, if on of those were to hit the shuttle, it could easili go strait through it, or damag it to a certain degre that would onli make their journei more difficult. Never fear though, scientist have work hard on a solut as to how thei will keep track of all the debris, and thei end up just give them differ code names, and keep a radar on them at all times, that wai thei know the safeti zone for what good, and what bad.
25076	9	It' basic like a debate, and thi wa hi side of things. He got the inform us to show that it is a problem, out there or Earth too, like it said, if it got into our atmosphere, it could serious do some damage, fall materi all over could wipe out million of people. It' also not healthi for the enviro of Earth and Space either. The earth could have some more junk all over, and if there is junk in pace then it could come realli pollut up there, who know how much of our thing is hurt everyone.
25077	9	He start with a grabber then he explain what space junk is. Then he talk about what happen in 2009, Then final start talk about the littl bit of trash in space.
25078	9	The author organ the articl by us certain part of history.
25079	9	The author organ thi articl by start out by state the problem and then move on to the specif section that describ differ issues, such as, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal' (Orbite Junk).
25080	9	The author organ hi thaught by put them in order.
25081	9	The author first start out with an introduct which inform us of what the articl is about. The author then goe in to a sublevel which tell us of what space junk is. The author sai that it is stuff that is lost in space and becom a free roam satellite. The author then goe into a differ sublevel call crash course. Thi warn us of what could happen when the space junk get released. The last sublevel is call littl bits, but a big deal. Thi sublevel tell us that space junk is quit small but it is veri danger becaus it fli at a rate of 5 mile per second.
25082	9	by tell what it is and then explan how it work
25083	9	The author organ the articl to give you support detail an event show the reader what end up in space after so long, then when it come time to get around it, the item ar to small to detect on radar so thei dont know everyth that is float around out there?
25084	9	The author organ the articl in a understand way. He ha the titl 'Orbite Junk' which tell the reader that overal idea. Then he ha subtitl for when he chang the matter of deatial on space junk. For exampl hi first subtitl is 'What Is Space Junk?' In that passag he explain throughli to the reader what space junk is. He also stai on topic. For each section he write about he dosen't get off topic he stai specif about what he write about.
25085	9	It is just talk about junk and how it can be used.
25086	9	The author organ the articl by have differ headlin talk about the stuff that ha happen or can happen in space.
25087	9	First the author ha an interest introduct that realli grab a reader attention. Next, the author describ what exactli is be talk about. Then the problem that the space junk form is talk about and previou incid that have happened. The last paragraph show the reason why it is import and how it is dangerous.
25088	9	Organiz an articl in a wai that the reader becom interest is not alwai an easi task. Thi author, however, did a great job. In stead of start off with bring fact about space, the author decid to us a sens of humor that get the reader' attention. After this, the author organ the articl in a wai that maxim the educ of 'space junk' befor the articl goe into the harm of it while in space.
25089	9	The author of thi articl organ thi articl by us differ topic throughout the peice. He us head when he chang thought as well. These head help to let the reader understand that he is chang topic and that he is keep numer paragraph under the same topic. He organ thi piec veri well and keep the work veri consistant.
25090	9	He us defer section to organ the inform and group it together. there ar 4 section in thi paper
25091	9	He organ thi passag into mani different, descript parts. Each part tell part about space and how the equip in space is harmful.
25092	9	The author organ the articl by place inform under a titl of a section that appli to what is in the section. For example, in the section titl 'What Is Space Junk?', he tell you what space junk is and how it is form or created.
25093	9	The author organ the articl by split up the topic he want to cover, if he add a a titl to the topic he want to cover more peopl will be more will to read them or even keep read than if the topic wa just all bunch together, the author seper hi topic and explain what each topic is to help the reader understand the problem more easily.
25094	9	The author organ the articl by inform sections. Each section ha a specif topic the author explain to the reader. He/Sh break it down so the passag is more comprehensible.
25095	9	First, the author grap your attention. Then, explain space junk and reveal it a big deal.
25096	9	The author organ the articl with first an attent grabber. Such as, 'Grab you telescope'! 'Look up in the sky'! 'It' a comet'! 'It' a meteor'! Then the author get a more seriou tone becaus he is try to make a point and let you know how danger 'space junk' is. After this, the author let you know what space junk is. And what a crash cours is. Then he sai that littl bit can be a big deal and explain why. And last, he end it with all of it is a seriou problem.
25097	9	The author organ thi articl by first tell us what he is talk about then he explan to the reader what he is excatli talk about. The author then gose on to tell the reader what the effect of space junk ar do to space. The author put the articl in cronagal oder for the most part.
25098	9	The author support thi articl by seper the differ topic with subtitals. He seper all the inform into the follow sections, 'What is Space Junk,' 'Crash Course,' 'Littl Bits,' and 'But a Big Deal.' By organ the articl in thi wai the author ha made it easier for the reader to find the inform he or she wants.
25099	9	The author organ the articl by put head for the differ section to give a better idea about what that paragraph or paragraph ar go to be about. Just as the author put 'What is Space Junk?' & 'Crash Course' which give brief descript about each paragraph.
25100	9	The author us sub topics, or titl if you will, for mani of hi paragraphs. These titl let you know what the follow paragraph(s) ar about. For example, 'Crash Course' let you know that you wil probabl be read about satellit collisions. The author doe thi through out the article.Bi do so, he effect organ hi article.
25101	9	The author organ thi articl by section it off into subcatagori such as 'Crash Course' or 'LittleBits, But a Big Deal.'
25102	9	The author organ the articl by similar inform together. After the introduction, the author us a histor timelin of the space race to give the reader inform about how we got there. Then the author discuss how satellit can becom space junk. The author conclud by discuss how the littl bit of space trash can be harm to our space research.
25103	9	The author organ the articl by explain at first about the past and when thei first had found junk in space. Then he explain about how everyth went wroong becaus of someth so little.
25104	9	First he grab your attent with a exclammatori statement, then proce to explain the main idea of the passag and tell you a littl about satellites. After he explain the main idea, he goe a littl more in depth, and tell you what the problem is with have dead satellit in space. Lastly, he explain that even the smallest space debri can pose a veri seriou hazard to a person.
25105	9	The author organ thi articl by put differ titl and section when he is discuss a new topic. Like he put 'What is Space Junk?' to tell us more about what thi term is and then he made a new paragraph 'Crash Course' so that he could explain what thi 'space junk' is do to us, and what is happen around us. I think that it wa good he put it into differ section becasu it make it less confus and it help us understand the differ part of the stori better.
25106	9	He organ is veri well and clearli spoken. With question what peopl opihnion' ar while learn more about the situation.
25107	9	The auther organ thi articl by importance. It would be import to know what space junk is befor you read the other paragraph to know what happen to space junk.
25108	9	The author first defin what 'space junk' realli is for those that ar unawar of what it is and how it get where it is. Follow 'What is Space Junk?' is 'Crash Course'. Thi section of the articl give an exampl of when a dead Russian satelit and a dead American satelit crash into eachother. 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal' is the last section and give the effect that some of these small piec of debri can harm spacecraft and even astronauts.
25109	9	The author organ the articl in order. First he made the introduct appeal by write 'It' a comet! It' a meteor! It' a tool bag?' to get the reader attent of what space junk is. After he explain what space junk is, by tell how all started. Then he explain how the satellit collid with each other. And final he explain the problem space junk caus to space craft and how ar countri try to fix the problem.
25110	9	The author start the articl with an attent grabber to spark some interest for the readers. Thei then wrote about the last few decad of space explor to help the reader understand how often and how much we as a speci clutter outer space. Finali the author talk about how much damg thi 'space junk' can caus to better our understand of what the consequ ar of satalit crash or other accid in space.
25111	9	she eplain it in differ paragraph and break it down to understand better of what it is and how it wa created.
25112	9	The author made the introduct a Attention getter. Than he/sh made titl which wa follow up behind by Details.
25113	9	The author organ the articl by build up the inform about space junk and how it will effect futr spece exploration.
25114	9	The author organ the articl by begin with a few question that mai seem humor in order to set a tone of interest in the reader as thei begin read the article. The author then proce to chang the tone for he rest of the articl to assum a more seriou demeanor sinc he want to creat emphasi on the danger of the topic. The author, after the introduction, begin by defin what space junk is and how it occurs- provid strictli fact or background inform on space junk in order to provid an idea about what the articl is basic about and to give the reader a rudementari understand of the subject befor the reader is subject to more inform or opinion on the subject. The author can then go more deepli into the effect of space junk and who is monitor it and how it can be harm to futur space exploration.
25115	9	The author organ the articl by us subhead to talk about differ subject in the same topic. For exampl on of the subhead is call 'What Is space junk?' in that section he talk about the type of object circl around space. In the subhead 'Crash Cours he talk about satellit crashing. Thei talk about the same topic which is relat to space junk but differ subject like how satellit crash.
25116	9	first he explain what ...
25117	9	He start it off with excit statement so he can get the reader attent and then he start goin into good detail about how the space junk can be a seriou problem.
25118	9	Well he tell that space is full of stuff and what thr reader to know the improtantic of it all.
25119	9	The author organ the articl into group of paragraph us bold words, such as 'What Is Space Junk?', or 'Crash Course.'
25120	9	The author organ the articl veri neatly. The author ha the articl divid into sections, each of which ha it' own purpose.
25121	9	The articl start out with a catchi introductionbi tell reader to 'Grab your telescope!' The second paragraph goe right into defin what 'space junk' is and how it is harmful. It then talk about how satellit crash can creat debris. The articl goe on to talk about the fact that the debri creat cannot be detect if it is smaller than a baseball. Thi mean that it is hard for spacecraft to steer clear of the debris. The author discrib thi as grain of sand be shot from a sandblast to strip paint from a concret wall.
25122	9	The author organ thi articl by talk about space junk and how harm it is to talk about crash and how littl thing can be a big deal.
25123	9	He start out by explain a small portion of the problem. The author then goe in to describ what space junk is defin as so there is a better understand of the problem. The author goe on to state that all satellit will eventu crash into some kind of object at some point and how big of an issu it realli is. Then the author describ that even though the piec mai be realli small there is still a larg possibl that it can damag the satellit and spacecraft.

25127	9	The author organ the articl by topics. The autor will start a new section by ad a titl to inform the reader what it will be about. The articl on Crash Cours is simpli explain the number of collis made everi year in space.
25128	9	The author us the last sentenc from on paragraph to lead into the next paragraph. In the last sentenc of the first paragraph the author write 'Thi space junk is current of great concern...', then the titl of the next paragraph is What is Space Junk? The author organ the paragraph in such a wai as to lead us onto the next topic of discussion.
25129	9	The author organ the articl by tellin what is space junk and how why it thier and what happen to th satillt onc it ha crash into anoth and then he axplain what it look like in space onc it ha turn into microscop peic and is orbit around the solour system.

Then he realli inform you on the origin of how space junk came to be with 1957 Soviet Union launc the first artifici satellite. Which wa soon follow by te first USA satellite. Then he explain how the space junk is affect current space explor and project by the debri destroi high tech, veri expens machin in space. Thi wa a veri easi to understand wai to read how over time a tini piec of debr can becom a monument problem.
25135	9	He organ it like it a caus and effect essay.
25136	9	The author organ thi articl by first grab our attenion with the us of a seemingli absurd statement, the nexplain wh ythe statement is not absurd. He then tell us the origin of space junk, some incid caus by it, and the linger porblem of space junk in chronolog order.
25137	9	Throughout the article, the author organ each section by the gener time of the action. After the beginning, when the autor captiv the attent of the reader, the author begin to tell the reader about the first launch of space satellites, and the particular element of space science.

25139	9	The author organ the articl by go in order of importance, or relev information. The author first explain what space junk is by give the reader a brief overview of the definit and histori of spacejunk. Next, the author discuss how space junk can come about, explain that dead satellit mai ultim mulitpli into a mass amount of space junk if said satellit crash into anoth dead satellite. Finally, the author stress the import of the danger of space junk, state that ani microdebri smaller than the size of a basebal can go undetected. Thi undect microdebri mai pose as a seriou threat to space travel becaus the microdebri mai caus harm to the spacecraft.
25140	9	The author start by make a simpl statement. Than he explain what 'Space junk' is and how it caus our Earth mani problems. In the third sections, the author explain crash course, which is uncontrol satellit that collid with each other caus piec of debri to fly through space.In hi final section, he explain that even though the problem is small it still a big deal. The paragraph explain a small fragment travl at the speed of five mile per second can caus seriou damage.Which is follow by the auther sai that the problem is increasing.Th whole articl explain and show more inform to us to better understand.
25141	9	The Author put everyth in section so that it is easi to understand.
25142	9	The author organ thi articl by tell what space junk is then how it effect and other thing such as satellites. Also, the author give exampl to help compar what it is like for a small piec of debri in space smash into a satellite. One exampl from the articl to give us an idea of what it is like in space, like if a grain of sand were blow in the wind vs a grain of sand chip paint off of a wall.
25143	9	by explain difer problem and cours

She next tell us the damag done in the 'Crash Course' section. In the end the author express to us how littl particl can caus the most damge.
25146	9	He make it excit at first then settl down and get seriou about the satellit and how import thei are, and how danger it is if thei hit stuff.
25147	9	The author organ hi inform by organ it by the topic or incid it pertain too. For example, thei sort all the inform about the satellites' collis of 2009 into a paragraph titl 'Crash Course.' Also, thei titl the paragraph tell the reader exactli what thi cosmic debri is in a paragraph titl 'What is Space Junk?'
25148	9	thei explor the va reach of the solar sistem monitor atmospher condit and make global wireless
25149	9	First the author grab our attent with hi first statement by act as if he' tell you to look in the sky. Next He us on paragraph to sum up just the topic of hi article.

25187	9	tell the danger of space
25188	9	It goe in sequence, start with what orbit around the earth. Then it tell us about what is orbit around the earth. It then tell us that eventu everyth in the outerspac will collid and it will hit the earth and explod into littl pieces.
25189	9	Thi is organ by the background inform on the story. which wa how the satellit wa built and mani other thing like that.
25190	9	by name everi type of problem that can go on up in space
25191	9	The author is organ and ha veri goood support detail that ar true.
25192	9	The organ is from past to present. He first tell you about the orbit of space an what is out thier. Then he call it junk becaus sometim the stuff thei lost or put in space becom veri danger to the planet but no on knows. The reason why becaus if you tell peopl the truth thei wouldnt know how to handl it or how to act when you tell them. Some peopl over exzager the problem and caus all kind of confusion. Space is a danger place to enter and plai around with. There is no graviti or oxygen to provide, unless your on a spaceship. Most time space ship ar not even safe. Some peopl can not handl move slow or see thing thei have never seen before. He wa tell about the spaceship that wa first launch in 1957 by the Soviet Union but it wa artifici and the the Unite State follow suit. Whicha began the human race' great space invation. Thing like that caus confus to everyon who can not ak it. He also wa give inform about the varieti of spacecraft their wa and about the global communicaton an how thei launch spaceships. He kept it plan an simpl and to the point how distrut peopl ar to their world and even to outerspac that is most danger to the earth. In conclusion, the fact that the matter is. No matter how big, small, tini or larger object ar it is so danger to peopl an the earth and it' surroundings. It could caus major damag to peopl and the earth if it fall straight out from the sky.

25195	9	That the space ar som what alik and the differ time but yetth problem is certain to persist.
25196	9	Tell peopl about the space jumk and realiz that peopl realli care about thi stuff and thei should pai attent on what hap with earth today.

The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?', explain how spacecraft in the atmospher can result in junk that begin to circl Earth in an uncontrol orbit. 'Crash Course' explain why govern ar concern with the debri by illustr a crash between satellites. The conclusion, 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal', explain that the problem is onli increas and space agenc ar try desper to end the space pollut and damage.
25203	9	The author organ the articl by start off with an interest introduction, and head from there to the histori and the seriou thing that peopl need to know about space craft and how it effect our solar system.
25204	9	He organ the articl in a wai to make it easier for the reader to read. The wai he ha a name for each section like 'What is Space junk?' and 'Crash Course'. It just make it easier to follow.

Thi is to foreshadow the stori of the accid in which a toolbag escap the grip of an astronaut dure a repair on the Internat Space Station. The author proce to explain what 'space junk' is, and how much of it is formed. The articl explain the danger of dead satellit that can crash into each other. It explain that with the increas of space exploration, there will be a collect increas of space junk. The author sai that mani peopl care about the space junk, offer opposit to reader who ar indiffer to thi issue. The author conclud that space agenc should work togeth to find a solut to thi import problem.

25207	9	The author organ the articl by separ differ inform into differ sections. For exampl on section label 'What Is Space Junk?' onli talk about what space junk is, and explain the histori of space junk.
25208	9	The author organ hi articl by the order in which it happen and by importance. The first on 'What Is Space Junk' , second 'Crash Course' and third, ' Littl Bits,But a Big Deal'.
25209	9	The author organ thi articl in a veri clever way. First, the author describ what space junk is and how it come about in space. Second, the author give exampl of how space junk effect satelit and other space equipment. Lastly, she explain the effort of the variou space administr who want to reduc the ammount of space debris, to show that thei share the same concern for the safeti of outer space just as we do.
25210	9	The author organ thi articl with chronolog inform bit and bit of inform lead into the main topic of the story.
25211	9	First the author ha a good hooker that make the reader want to continu to read the article. Then he/sh tell what the problem is that need to be fixed. Follow that ar detail of what ha happen as a result of the problem at hand. Final he/sh state what can and will happen from all the 'junk' in space.
25212	9	The author start the articl with a phrase that might be said by a normal person and grab their attent by sai someth not expect when thei sai it a tool bag. Thi first paragraph state what thi is. The next paragraph then explain what the space junk is and how it came about. The paragraph sai thi when it explain the great space invasion. Then the section crash cours explain the crash of orbit satellit and other orbit junk such as a tool bag. The last section explain how the junk is a big deal when it sai the debri from the space junk can caus hole in the space ship we design.
25213	9	He put them in order by how thei affect us.
25214	9	First, the author us unusu statement to grab the reader attetion. There is no wai that anyon would expect a tool bad to be in the sky. Then the author give some fact about space explor and explain what space junk is. After that the author give a specif anecdot about how an American and Russian satellit crashed. Thi crash caus much debri and pose a huge fdanger to ani futur space travel. Finally, the author explain how even veri small space debri can be veri danger to carefulli design spacecrafts.
25215	9	I think that the author organ thi articl veri well. The introduct wa veri attent grabing, it wa dramat and made me want to read more of it as it went on. Then he poss a question which led to a sort of histori leason. The author then give you inform about each topic us veri good exampl to give the reader a good idea of how someth so littl can be so harm when it is at a high rate speed.
25216	9	The author organ the articl by fist inform the reader with fact about the main subject, inform the read on the import of satellites.Giv import detail befor come with the conflict. The author gave detail to detail about the problem with 'space junk'. Then end with how the problem is soppos to be fixed. That is how the articl wa organ by the author.
25217	9	The author first state and observ found in space, and then he tell you what it is and explain space junk. Next, he tell you what thi space junk can cause. Then, he tell you why these littl thing ar big deal and what thei harm in space.
25218	9	The author us small titl and organ the articl from that.
25219	9	Thi articl is organ by topics. in the begin it excit to catch reader attention, and then it goe on to a more seriou mood.it tell you what 'space junk' is,then tell you why it is import and dangerous. after that it tell you about satellit and why thei ar a problem.aft that, it talk about the size of the trash and the danger of the speeds.
25220	9	the author organ the articl by dates.
25221	9	The author of Orbite Junk organ the articl by topics. These topic include, What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Littl Bits, But a Big Deal. Organiz thi articl into these catagori make it easier to read and comprehend for the readers. I believ it is a suffici wai to stai interest in the articl and to make it easier to read.
25222	9	The author organ the articl in a wai that give the reader backround inform about the pollut and hint at it possibl danger, but doesn't reveal it until the last section.

25224	9	The author organ the articl by stai on topic and he also indents. The author us a titl evertim he what to talk about a differ type of stuff about space.
25225	9	The auther of 'Orbite Junk' organ the articl by start with a good attent getter, follow by some brief histori of the subject, then talk about problem of the main idea, and end with a passag that leav reader think about the future.
25226	9	The author estori avob the inform and chose the most import
25227	9	The author start out by grab your attent with a few random statements. He/Sh then proce to describ what space junk is and some of the differ object that ar consid space junk. The author then goe into how space object can crash into other object and therefor make a million other tini objects. The author then talk about how these piec ar veri harmful. In the conclusion, the author talk about how space program ar try to come up with a wai to get rid of space junk.
25228	9	the aurthur organ it with a hook sentenc then hit you with some fact of space explor then tell you what the explor leav behind and how danger and seriou space trash is.
25229	9	The author sorgan the articl by make a statement and then give you inform on the statem like for exampl 4 In 1957 , the Soviet Union launch the first artifici satellit . Now, the statement to support what the author just said' The Unite State follow suit, and thu began the human race' great space invasion.
25230	9	I think how the author organ the articl is that the author want to give out inform about orbit junk in space and put into to section to inform the reader.
25231	9	The author organ the articl by first explain what the problem we face is in 'What Is Space Junk?', then the author state how space junk wa creat in 'Crash Course', and lastli the author explain why space junk is a big deal in 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal'.
25232	9	The articl 'Orbite Junk' is organ into four main sections. The introduct us shock statement in order to grab the reader' attention, and then begin to more serious address the fact and basic of space junk in the second section, 'What Is Space Junk?'. Follow that, the articl realli begin to stress the seriou natur of the space junk problem. Section three, titl 'Crash Course', relat both a stori of collis on a major scale, as well as how mere human error can creat a notabl problem. The final section, 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal', is both a descript of what even the smallest bit of space junk can do, as well as a summari and conclus to the article.
25233	9	The author organ the articl in an effect way. He start off tell the reader what 'space junk' is, then he goe on to describ the danger of the 'space junk', an final he sai why it such a big deal.
25234	9	He pust each part of the artic in it own chapter. start off not so serious. And work hi wai down to how it can impact the earth. and how it hard to work on stuff in space.
25235	9	The authur organ the articl by start it off with shock sai and paint of vivid imag of tool and tool bag fly through the air. Then the tone becom more seriou and the authur state more realist fact in an effort to draw our attent down the page. Then the authur leav us with a bit of a cliff hanger by state that the problem of fly space junk will not end soon in fact it is get worse. Around the world space agenc and nation a like ar work togeth in an effort to clean up the junk.
25236	9	First the author explain to us what space junk exactli is, therefor explain the first paragraph and title. Then the author explain how space junk come to be, from collid ship and satellites. Then the author explain how that debri affect us down on Earth.
25237	9	The author organ thi articl by topic. He put a catchi introduct first then follow up with explain the differ part of space explor in great detail. He give background inform on all of the topics.
25238	9	Thei orgin it with titl and subtitles. Thei also put all simil inform in on group.
25239	9	In the introduct the author catch your attent with the thought of someone. Then the author goe into the the fact about how thing got into space in the first place. The author then goe into why it bad to have thing in space. Then the author tell you why it danger and what will happen in the futur with space junk.
25240	9	The author make it seem like space travel is realli harmful but peopl do it all the time
25241	9	He talk about all of the problem with space junk and it effect on human and other things.
25242	9	The author organ thi articl accord to what you know and how you learn something. Such as the first section is to grab you attent so you want to read more. The second is to identifi and explain what the topic is. The third is to go more into depth about the topic, and the fourth is to explain why you should care, and the danger of the topic. It' organ as an inform persuad articl overall.
25243	9	He organ it by place what is us by human and fact about the satilit . And what goe on in space .
25244	9	In the articl there ar other articl that go with it. Thei ar broken up in catigori and have there own titles.
25245	9	The author start off by keep it simpl where everyon can follow along easily. Then he start a new head where he then begin to state fact that explain how space debre is danger and pollut space. After the new head he just us paragraph to finish off hi article.
25246	9	The autor organ the articl by start with event that happen first such as saying, ' In 1957 the soviet union launch the first artifici satilite.' Also state ' two commun satilites, on American and on Russian, both travel at more than 20,000 mile per hour, crash into each other 491 mile abov the Earth.'
25247	9	The author organ the articl by introuduc you to what the articl is about. Then it tell you the problem about space.
25248	9	He us them in order on which question would apear. If someon doesn't know why a tool bag would be in space, or want to know what space junk is, the auther tell them right off the bat. The auther talk about how thei colli and make smaller pieces, which explain the Crash Cours paragraph. It then talk about the littl piec that break off, which is the purpos for Littl Bits, But a Big Deal. Each paragraph ha a purpos and thei ar all in order.
25249	9	The author start with an open statment to get the reader attention. Then, he move on to the topic sentenc in the introduct to sai what the articl is about. The author us head to seper the articl into parts. After that, the author us bodi paragraph to explain what space junk is and explain the problem it could cause. Finally, the author tell what is go to comtinu happen for the conclusion.
25250	9	He orgin the passag by first introduc what it is then move each part into detail about a particular object. for exampl it start by ask what is space junk? and tell us all about it, then it goe into what caus it or as it is call crash course, and last he tell how he feel about all the space junk in the last paragraph call littl bits, but a big deal.
25251	9	He organ it into sever sections. Each section be about it own topic. One be about collis and how space debri appears. Another be the potentio problem that it could inflict. Then anoth about the hisori of space exploration.
25252	9	He organ the inform by a descript of what it is, about the effects, and how danger it can be. The titl in the articl ar clever and that give the reader an idea of what' to come.
25253	9	The author organ the articl by give a good start in the beggining. Start off eith an retor question and then follow with a seriou manner problem. The author then explain what apc junk is and how danger it can be. Then it continu with the dangerour crash in space. Crash then creat harmful debris. Then at the end explain that littl bit ar big deal to the earth.
25254	9	The author in thi articl is veri good about how he or she wrote it. The author start with an introduct that gave you a main idea about what your go to read. Then the author made sure you had the histori down befor you went ani further and after that gave you the main problem with space research. Overal it is a veri well put togeth article.
25255	9	The author organ the articl by first talk about all of the space part that ar orbit around the earth to help the reader better understand how mani thing ar in space. Next the author describ how danger leav 'high-tech junk' in space can be. The author give an exampl of the emphasi put on the strength of thi debri by sai ' instead of two disabl satellites, there ar hundr of microsatellit fly through space. The author continu on by try to keep the reader interest in how much of a problem the microsatellit can be in 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal'. The author finish by sai the problem is still increas instead of be fixed.
25256	9	It start off by state what 'space junk' is, then it give some history. Like back in 1957, the soviet union launch the first artifici satellite. Then, it talk about the risk of satellit run into eachoth caus piec of that to fly out into space. Space debri is a veri seriou problem, thei can be power enough to creat disastr hole in an object move through space.
25257	9	The author organ the articl by first explain what space junk is, which he sai ar piec of sattelit that get stuck in orbit. He explain how the junk come to be and what happen to it. He also give inform on how space junk come to be. It is caus when sattelit break or run into eachother. Lastly, he describ the bad effect space junk have. He sai all of the upcom space explor is increas the amount of space junk which is clutter the atomsphere. He sai the new amount is make space travel more difficult and everyon need to work togeth to limit the amounts.
25258	9	The author of thi articl organ hi work into sections. He began with in introduct to help introduc the problem and catch the reader attention. Then he explain the basic histori of what we have in our orbit in the section call 'What Is Space Junk.' Through 'Crash Course,' the author explain what the space junk doe that make it a problem to ani space program. Final he wrap up with hi conclus and explain how it effect us as a commun and a planet.
25259	9	The author organ thi articl by the import of each fact.
25260	9	Thei narrow the artic to more specif point
25261	9	The author organ in differ subsect that he or she believ fit together. I like thi idea becaus section like 'Crash Course' can easili be identifi as the section where collis ar found.
25262	9	The author organ thi stori into differ sections. The author first get our attent with the introductions. The author then give us some background inform on the histori of space junk and how it can effect the earth. Next, we find out how harm thi space junk realli is. It talk about the collis of satellit and how thei ar harm to earth. Final the author tell us that onc thei have collid thei ar form into littl bit that ar still a big deal. It is hard for spacecraft to steer clear of thi tini object.
25263	9	The author organ the articl in littl section to highlight each thing you need to know about Space Junk. Like the first section what is space junk, the author explain what Space Junk is and where it come from. The Crash Cours section talk about two satellit collid into each other. The Littl Bits, But a Big Deal section talk about the hazard of microdebri float through space, and the increas amount amount of Space Junk caus by commerci space travel.
25264	9	I realli dont understand the question you ar ak me.
25265	9	Thei talk about the histori of satelites.
25266	9	The author organ the articl in a veri good way. The introduct is first. Next, we find out what 'Space Junk' actual is. Then, It talk about how it is made when satellit collid and crash which caus it to form into smaller pice becaus everyth break apart at veri fast speeds.
25267	9	The authour organ the articl by folloow from the begin to where it talk about Space Junk. Secondli it goe from there to where it end to crash of the course. Lastli it goe to Big Deal where it talkl about 'tini fragment travel at speed of five mile per second can inflict seriou damag on the most carefulli design spacecraft'.
25268	9	The autor put it in A order where the reader will know where to look to find inform
25269	9	Well he start off as like in a excit tone but then goe into detail about how space junk ja came to be and made our solar system veri veri danger and how a lot of our satelit can be destroi from these littl piec of debri move at a high rate of speed.
25270	9	THE AUTHOR ORGANIZE THE ARTICLE BY BREAKING EACH OF THE THING HE WANT TO TLAK ABOUT INTO THREE LITTLE SECTION. LIKE THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY JUST TELLING YOU ABOUT THE JUNK THE BE IN SPACE AND THE SECOND IS TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU CAN CRASH WHY YOU IN SPACE IF YOU DONT HAVE ALL CONTROL OF YOUR SPACESHIP. AND THE LAST ONE JUST TALKS ABOUT LILTTLE THINGS THAT CAN FALL FROM SPCAE AND SOME PEOPLE DONT THINK THAT ITS A BIG DEAL BUT IT IS.
25271	9	The author organ the articl by not just put idea in paragraph but also put them in group with titl for that paragraph or group of paragraphs.

25273	9	The auther organ thi artical by start thi articl with a shock statement to make the reader want to read the article. After the auther ha the reader attention, the auther us fact to show the danger of space junk and why it is a big deal.
25274	9	He explain what it is, what happen due to that space junk, and then some fact about what ha happened.
25275	9	After the introduction, the author defin what thei ar talk about. The first section is 'What is Space Junk?' In thi section, the author talk about what space junk is and how it is formed. The second second is call 'Crash Course' and it is about the danger of the space junk. And then the author transit into a relat topic, tini bit of space trash. The author talk about the danger of even a small bit of space debris. The author conclud by talk about the current state of the problem of space junk and inti to try and solv the problem of space junk. Throughout the entir story, it is a progression. Set the stori up, defin term and talk about how thei ar formed, what role thei play, what damag thei can do, and final wai to stop the problem.
25276	9	The author start with a catchi introduct that is an allus to a common phrase from 'Superman.' He/sh continu on with explain in gener what space junk is, and how some of it got into space. 'Crash Course,' the next section of the article, explain in more detail of two incid in space that creat space debris, a crash and a drop tool box. Finally, the last few paragraph explain why the littl peic of space debri have such an impact due to the high speed at which thei travel. It also mention why we should be conceren and how thi problem, if not solv quickly, will becom an even larger issu due to more and more space travel in the near future.
25277	9	The author organ the articl by introduc the concept of space junk in a fun wai but quickli get seriou as the articl pass. He explain space junk by review the space age, then get to the matter at hand. He state that space junk is mostli creat by satalit collis in on articl and also state that microdebri from the space junk is veri harm to astronauts. The author explain the problem veri well through a seri of paragraphs.
25278	9	The author grab the reader' attent with the open paragraph. The follow section ar us to explain what exactli the author is relat to you.Th author provid head to give you an idea of what you will be inform about next.
25279	9	The author organ the articl by seper it into section of what happen and what thei do to help. The section ar the introduction, What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Littl Bits, But a Big Deal. These section tell us exactli how harm space junk is and how it is caused.
25280	9	He start off the articl with interest statement that shock you into do it. Once he realiz you ar pai attent he then start to tell you about the histori of satellites. The author tell you about some crashest that have happen to keep you interested, and then goe back into import fact that you need to know such as how the smallest thing can turn into the biggest problems.
25281	9	The author goe by topics, and provid fact and sometim hi own opinion in the paragraphs. He start out some of the paragraph with quesitons, and then he answer them. He back up all of hi paragraph with veri well us information.
25282	9	The author start off by explain what space junk is, then explain how it can caus minor problem along with seriou on and why peopl should care. The tool bag is on of the issues. Also, the author give inform about a solut and how the problem is onli get worse.
25283	9	Becaus thei tell all about the space stuff.
25284	9	She put subtitl to try to divid the import of space.
25285	9	The author organ thi articl into catagori and paragraphs. Each section in the stori ha it own signifc to the background knowledg and effect of space junk. The section titl 'What is Space Junk?' refer to what it realli is and how long it been in our orbit.
25286	9	He start with what it is about then tell some of the histori about it then tell what is go to happen if were not careful.
25287	9	farili decent
25288	9	The author begin with a catchi lead in, then he dive into the real issue: Space Junk. He then give us a brief over view of Space Junk history, and NASA history. He then explain how 'dead' satellit ar a major issue, and what thei can do to on another. He also explain other form of debris. Then he final come to hi point, why it a big problem, and how we ar try to fix it.
25289	9	The author start with a lucr introduct and move into the background information. Once the caus of the junk ha been defined, the author tell the major caus of debri such as satellit crash and accid by astronauts. It then goe onto describ how and why we need to fix thi veri seriou problem that we have caus by careless space exploration. The author then come to a conclus that the problem will ensu despit effort to contain it.
25290	9	The author argan the articl be have differernt titl in the on article. The author doe it by the import of how it should be inform to other

25292	9	The author organ the articl by give each differ section a titl like, What is Space Junk, or Crash Course, to give you an idea of what the section is about.
25293	9	The author start off by state what he see in the sky, is noth but a simpl tool bag. then he shoot right into detail about space junk. The author explain to us, that space junk is more of a problem than we might see it as. He goe on by tell us how danger it could be and how it could occur, then state that engin ar seek and ad improv to spacecraft and spacesuits, so thei can withstand thi 'space junk.'
25294	9	The author organ the articl by start off with an attent getter in the introduction. After the introduct the author startst to us a seriou tone with the reader. He start to defin how the problem started. The author then goe through and start to emphas the thing that you read in the article.

Then, the author begin to defin how object releas in space will alwai orbit the planet, even after thei have malfunctioned. Thi creat a 'great concern to govern space agenc around the globe'. The author then address the topic of how space debri is created. for exampl when 'two commun satellites...both travel at more than 20,000 mile per hour' crashed, thei produc hundr of piec of debris. Next, the author inform the reader of how these tini piec can be veri harm and dangerous. In addit to the danger thei pose, 'the problem is certain to persist.'

Then the author give an exampl of a crash in space between two satelit that ran into eachoth and made milion of tini satelites. The author conclud the articl by talk about what scientist can do to prevent space junk in the future.
25299	9	The author organ the articl by first describ what is space junk. Space junk is a varieti of spacecraft, includ space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earht' atmosphere. Then the author simpli tell about all the thing that ar includ in the sapc junk.
25300	9	The author organ the articl into four sections: The introduction, which introduc the reader to space junk with an anecdot occurence, 'What Is Space Junk?', which describ countless object orbit the Earth, 'Crash Course', which descib the event of satellit and other orbit object crash into eachother, and 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal', which explain how seriou space junk is, and what problem it can cause.
25301	9	The author organ the artic from least import to most important.
25302	9	The author organ the articl with sever differ piec of write put into one. It make thi articl a good read.
25303	9	The articl is organ by certain topics. Each paragraph is about someth specific. For example, the 'Crash Course' paragraph is mainli about collison of the 'space junk.' 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal' is about how smaller debris, move at a high speed, can still caus a lot of damage.
25304	9	the wai he got everyth organ is like he got everyth label and know where exactli where too go.
25305	9	The articl follow cause-and-effect organiz pattern. From the prelud in the introduction, it move onto a descript of the histori of space travel; furthermore, it descbrib how a celesti satellit becom 'space junk.' In the last part of the article, entitl 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal,' it explain how the microscop piec of loos materi up in space can becom a danger problem to travel satellites. From the caus of space pollut to the effect of danger environ in space travel, the organ help to understand the natur of the problem at hand. Furthermore, the articl is divid into label section describ the common theme for the compilations.
25306	9	The author ordan the articl by caus and effect. he sai that we send stuff into space but when we do some of the stuff becom free flow junk in space.
25307	9	The author first tell us a statist about space junk be veri harmful. He then tell us about the histori of satellites, and he tell us about how the term 'space junk' wa first talk about. The author now talk about satellit collid with each other and creat all of thi debris. Now, he final tell about how much of a big deal thi matter is in our world.

25309	9	The author organ the articl by first grab our attent to read the article. Then he/sh tell us mainli what the articl is about, conclud why the first titl into the read is 'What Is Space Junk'. After read that information, we now can be educ with neg effect of satellites. Finally, in the conclus we can relat the satellit to our environ today.
25310	9	The author organ it in the same wai I think I would if I wa write a paper on thi topic. To start off the articl the author us a funni statement ot try and drag the reader in, as seen in the first two lines. Then he try to inform the reader of the histori of space travel and how the junk get into space in the first place, as seen in the second paragraph. Next the author tri to inform hi reader about some of the major accid that creat alot of space junk, he doe thi when he explain the instanc of the two satalit colliding. Lastli the author tri to explain to the reader that the space junk mai be small but it is veri dangerous, as seen when the author sai that the bit even though thei ar small present a veri serio problem. Then he end the articl by tell the reader of the fact that the amount of space junk is actual increasing.
25311	9	He give great reason and citing, in all paragraphs.
25312	9	He orhan thi articl in to differ section to help the reader understand what thei ar go to talk about next. An exampl of thi is the titl What is space junk the us thi to show that thi is waht you ar go to read about.
25313	9	The author organ the articl by have four differ section of information. The purpos of the first section is to grab the reader attention. The second section give background inform on what space junk is and where space junk is located. The third section inform reader about the risk space junk ha on us. It also inform the reader how the crahs take place and at what speed thei take place at. The last section talk about why space junk is hard to stear clear of.
25314	9	The author us an introduct to grab the reader attention. The us some humor dialogu to get the reader interest and to introduc the topic of the article. The follow section goe into detail about the focu of the articl by explain what space junk is and what it becomes. Crash Cours give real exampl to ellabor the danger of space junk such as when the two satellit collid with on another. The final section discuss the current situat and overal impact that space junk ha by give the exampl of sand be blown by a breez of blown out of a sandblaster. Thi elabor on the damag that small piec of space junk can do.
25315	9	he organ it in small section that protain to what he is talk about. such as what is space junk, and crash course.
25316	9	He set it up as if he is go to tell a stori and read it to you and he start tell you fact about space and how all the stuff works.
25317	9	The author organ it by put a subject abov the paragraph to let you know what those paragraph ar about. It' like a book with chapters, but in an article.
25318	9	The author organ the articl veri well. He had the introduction, and then he put the differ paragraph into catogroies. He explain what is space junk? He tell you about Crash Course. How the satellit crash and how it is danger to have alot of satellit in space. The author also put in a section about Littl Bits, But a Big Deal. He is tell you that all the littl thing smaller than a basebal is difficult for a spacecraft to steer clear.
25319	9	The author start with a light-heart introduction. Then the author continu by explain serious what space junk is and the effect it ha on space missions,etc. The author includ fact and date about space mission themselv and end with the hope of come up with a solut for space pollution.
25320	9	The author organ the articl by histori and then to revenl point to the subject of the articl base on the other titles.
25321	9	The author organ the articl by the littlest problem to the buggest problem.

25323	9	he talk about space jumk ant the great space race
25324	9	He start out get the reader attent by ask question and have humor. Then thei get more seriou and start to explain what space junk is. Thei also give inform about statlit and the danger of the space junk and satalit be together.
25325	9	The author organ the articl into three differ sections, plu an introduction. The introduct introduc the idea of space junk to the reader and the section 'What Is Space Junk?' explain what space junk is. 'Crash Course' describ how space junk is creat and 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal' focus on small space debris.
25326	9	By have subtitl in the articl such as : What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, Littl Bits, and But a Big Deal.
25327	9	Throughout thi articl the author list variou fact about space. The author start it like a convers and then turn it into a factual articl about space. Veri entertain i veri much enjoi it.
25328	9	The author organ the articl by tell the reader about satellit first then go deeper into detail about all the junk that fly around in outter space. The author explain thi veri well I thought.
25329	9	The author organ the articl in a veri ey grab way. He strt out with some veri enthusiast comment to grab your attention. Once he grab your attent he bring up the issus of space junk. He keep it intrest though. He also ha fact to back everyth up.
25330	9	He start out by just ecplain what space junk is. Then he goe into detail about what it is and why it is harm and why we dont need it up there.
25331	9	The author orgin the articl by ad fact of stuff that had happen in space. It tell you how space junk got into the space and is now a big problem for satellit and space ships.
25332	9	The author organ the articl by time. He ha it from on thing happen to the next in the order thei happened.
25333	9	The author oran the articl first to catch our attention. He then Goe into inform about Space Junk and how it is harmful. After he talk about how danger crash cours are. Then he pursu to talk about how these thing ar littl but a huge deal! The author is a veri intellig an organ man the articl wa fantastic.
25334	9	The author give us detail inform about how satellit began and what happen to them if the would crash into anoth satellite. That the space trash form that crash would fall to earth or it go destori anoth satellit like a sandblas blast paint off concret. The tini fragment would peric throught that object and possobl bring it down.
25335	9	IT TALKS ABOUT SPACE. AND HOW THE SPACE JUNK IS EVERYWHERE. IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT IT INCREASING BECASUE COMMERCIAL SPACE TRAVEL IS THE RISE AN MORE NATIONS HAVE UNDERTAKEN SPACE EXPLORATION.
25336	9	The auther tell us everi thing we put in space will come back and hurt us on of these days. He thell us everi thing that can go wrong. I tink we should stop pute our crap in space.
25337	9	he creat a organ paper of all the catagori he want to talk about it wasnt all clutter togeth under on titl he space it out.
25338	9	He first start off with an intrigu introduct that main purpos is to grab the reader' attention. He then goe in to a brief histori of space exploration, and then how space debri is made. He then proce to give the reader multipl explan on how space debri is harmful.
25339	9	He caught my attent in the introduction. Then he slowli fill my head with interest fact about space junk in in the fourth and fifth paragraph of thi passage. Then in the last two paragraphs, he talk about the serious about the junk in space.
25340	9	He start out get the reader attent and the gradual get into more detail explain how harmul space junk can be
25341	9	The author begin with an excit introduct to grasp the reader' attent and keep them reading. Then, after the excit is over, he address the topic serious and describ the danger of 'space junk'. While explain this, the author divid differ portion of the articl by us sub-head such as 'What Is Space Junk?' or 'Littl Bits, But a Big Deal.' These sub-head clarifi the mainpoint for the reader and make the articl easier to understand.
25342	9	It grab your attet in the introduction. It tell you a littl bit of inform about space exploration. It tell about the risk of object run into each other. Also tell how the realli small particl of space garbag pose a big problem.
25343	9	Peopl alwai think that satellit ar all control in control, howev some of them ar not, and there ar a great possibl that the will ran in to each other.
25344	9	The author organ thi in a wai that everyon can at least try to understand. It not just a bunch of space talk or big word that someon would have to look up just to know what thei ar reading.
25345	9	The author organ the articl by break it down into differ sections. The introduct tell what the rest of the articl will be about. Then, the author us the titl What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Littl Bits, But a Big Deal to talk about differ topics. Under each topic, the author explain the title.
25346	9	The author start each paragraph with a differ topic relat to space and the specif problem involv space. Like the second paragraph, which is call 'What Is Space Junk'? Thi paragraph is tell you what ha been put into our space and what is make it crowded.
25347	9	The author organ thi articl in a veri specific, yet uniqu style. Instead of combin the articl into one, the author put everyth into a category. One categori can simplifi the understand of the text. As the reader read on categori at a time help with read comprehension. Perhap the author had no clue as to how to combin everyth into one, or had too much inform to combin it all into one. The first 'category' act as an introduct while the second 'category' act as the main story. Yes, the author could have organ the articl in a differ way, but he stood out and made the text easier to understand. I strongli believ that the author did thi to get the reader drawn into the story.
25348	9	The author is talk about differ fact in the article. So there'r differ headlin for ever subject.
27589	10	black :: Thi color could possibl make the dog hous warmer.
27590	10	white :: It will affect the doghous by make it nice and fresh insid the doghous
27591	10	white :: brandi and jerri would have to paint the dogh ous white because; the sun doesnt make alot of wite thing hot. Caus on the data tabl it show that the color white doesnt effect the sun alot sinc it a lighter color.
27592	10	white :: White doe not absord as much light as a dark er color make the insid of the doghous not as warm as it could be. In the experiment, the lowest temperatur averag wa white with 42(DEG). The next temperatur wa light grai with 45(DEG), after that it just goe s up higher
27593	10	black :: I would pick black.Thi color will effect the dog hous by keep the dog hous warm.Mi support is that in the data t abl it show that the Averag temperatur for the color black insid a g lass jar wa 53(DEG)C And the lowest temperatur wa white and white Av rage data was42(DEG)C. Dark Grei and Light Grei had a median of 48(DEG) C for Dark Grei and 45(DEG)C for Light grey.Thi show that the Black co lor would keep the dog the most warmest
27594	10	dark grai :: Using dark grai would make the dog hous an averag of 48(DEG)C. If you us black it would be too hot in the summer but if you us white it would be too cold in the winter, and the reason why I didn't choos light grai is becaus the dog would most like be in the dog hous at night when it' colder and not so much dure the day, especi in the summer.
27595	10	light grai :: By us thi color for the doghous it will have the perfect temperatur insid the doghous becaus it will be abou t 45(DEG) inside, which isn't too cold or too hot and that might make th e dog happy.
27596	10	white :: If the color of the dog hous wa white then the air temperatur insid of it would be cooler than if the color wa black. The averg temp. for the color black wa 53(DEG) C, and the averag temp. for the color white wa 42(DEG) C. The differ between them is 11(DEG).
27597	10	white :: White paint would keep the doghous cool. You know thi becaus white had the lowest averag air temperatur after ten minut under the lamp.
27598	10	white :: it dose not absorb the light as much
27599	10	black :: i sai it should be black.First of all becaus ,lesser air will go insid the doghouse, sinc it ah more darker color a nd pluz it ha an averag of 54(DEG) in averag of heat insid a glass j ar.
27600	10	dark grai :: The dog hous will be hot due to the absorbst ion of heat from the color of the house,thi will help the dog stai warm r dure cold night and the winters.
27601	10	white :: It will keep the heat out of the doghous bec aus white reflect heat and will keep the doghous cool. I know th is becaus of how the white jar heat up the slowest in the experiment.
27602	10	black :: Black could affect the insid of the dog hou e becaus it will keep the dog hous veri warm so the dog won't get cold. I think thi is true becaus accord to the data the averag temperatu re of a black color wa 53(DEG)C, which wa the high data and the averag temperatur for the white col or wa onli 42(DEG)C, which is the low data. And the black temperatur w as 11(DEG) warmer then the white temperature. so that mean the black co lor will keep the dog warm.
27603	10	black :: if thei paint the doghous black then the dog could sleep in it overnight becaus of the warmth. the averag tem peratur of the black jar wa 53 degre while the white jar wa on ly 42 degrees.
27604	10	white :: dog have a lot of fur to keep them warm so o n a summer dai thei want to cool down. Black is not a good chose becaus it asbord a lot heat white doe not. The color white will affect the do g hous by be less hot then a black dog hous will be.
27605	10	dark grai :: It Would Be About An Averag Temperature. It s Not 2 Hot Or 2 Cold.
27606	10	dark grai :: Dark grai might affect the doghous becaus i t would warm up the dog without the dog get to hot.
27607	10	light grai :: thi cler would keep the dog hous cool and k eep a littl warmpth in side
27608	10	black :: Thi color will keep the dog hous warmer bec aus it ha a lower albedo. Also in the experi it had the highest of the Averag tempertur with 53(DEG).
27609	10	dark grai :: tgfyfgfgccghjhjhgcgtchfhjfgfcc
27610	10	white :: from the result i would pick white becaus i t wa the coolest (a in temperature).that wai the dog would be abl to s tai in a place that not to hot and it provid protect from the sun.th e lighter color absorb less heat other than the darker color so it shou ldent be that hot.so thei should paint the dog hous white or ani other l ighter color but not the darker colors.
27611	10	black :: it wont
27612	10	white :: The white color will be the best becaus it i s not as dark as black and white absorb less heat than black, the dog hous will be about the same temperatur as the outsid with the white paint. The show result of white is that it collect less heat energi than the other darker colors.
27613	10	black :: Have a black doghous would make the doghou se warmer on the inside. In Brandi and Jerry' experiment, us a black lid had an averag of 53(DEG) C, while the other lighter color had av rage of 48, 45, and 42(DEG) C. Therefore, us black would be the best choic for a doghous color.
27614	10	light grai :: If the doghous wa black or dark grai it mig ht get to hot for the dog. If it wa white it might be to cold for the do g so i decid that ligh gai wa a good color.
27615	10	white :: The color white might effect the doghous by caus the air temperatur to be low in the summer sinc lighter color obsorb less energi thi is proven becaus a black lid averag 53(DEG)c and the white lid averag a 42(DEG)c, wich is in fact much cooler than the black lid temperature.
27616	10	white :: I choos white for the colopr of the dog hou e,becaus that wai it wont be so hot for the dog.In the experi Brandi and Jerri found the lighter the color,th less sun it atracts.
27617	10	light grai :: I would us light grai becuas it more on th e cooler side for tempatur and it wont over heat it when the sun if we would to be lai in hi dog house.
27618	10	white :: It will keep the insid of the doghous from get to warm dure the summer.
27619	10	light grai :: It might fit becaus black wouldnt go eit the dog if the dog is a light color then a light grai if the dog is a drak c olor then drak grai would match him but the draker color the more thei di e it would be better if the doghous wa light grai becaus the lighter c olor dont make you sweat more
27620	10	black :: the dog hous will not affect the dog hous t he black paint for the doghous will keep it cool.
27621	10	white :: White would be a good color beacaus it would make the dog hous be fresh insid not so hot. Acord to the data tabl e white got the lowest averag air tempatur for how hot it get bu t black got the most highest.
27622	10	white :: Brandi and Jerri should paint the dog hous w hite becaus the jar with the white lid had the lowest temperatur insid the jar, and it averag wa 42(DEG) C. Thi wai the insid of the dog hous will stai cool and not get to hot.
27623	10	white :: I think that if thei were build a dog hou e thei should us a white paint color, becaus then the doghous will be cool instead of hot becaus the paint is lighter.
27624	10	white :: The wite paint will keep the dog hous cooler , becaus in the experiment, the white paint had the lowest tempuratur a fter ten minuutes, be 11 degre cooler than the black paint, with a t emp of 54 degrees.
27625	10	dark grai :: Dark grai wa the most consist energi absorber. With an averag of 48(DEG)C the dog hous will not be too cold or hot and is capeabl of mainta an consist temperatur all year long.
27626	10	white :: i choos the color white becaus if it is a s unni dai outsid and the dog want some shade he will go in the dog hous becaus the white doe not attract energi as much as black. the dog ho us will be nice and cool for the dog.
27627	10	white :: it would stai cooler than a darker on would becaus it doesn't absorb energi like a darker on would.
27628	10	light grai :: Using the light grai paint would be good beca us it still dark to the point where it will collect energi but not a wh ol lot to the point where the dog is die from the heat, but not light enough to the point where the dog isn't get ani energi from the sun.
27629	10	white :: The color of the dog hous could affect the t emperatur make the dog hous cooler. thi is true becaus in the exp riment the white color jar wa the coldest with and averag of 42(DEG) c.
27630	10	light grai :: The color, light gray, will make the doghous cool in the summer and still keep it a littl warm in the summer.
27631	10	white :: White will make it cooler in there so when it sunni out the dog can go in there and won't burn up. After 10 minut the white lid averag 42 degre so that mean it cooler then the black lid which after 10 minut averag 53 degre
27632	10	black :: The color might affect the outsid of the dog hous becaus in the summer it might get lighter and the winter it might get darker
27633	10	white :: White would be the best color becaus white will keep the insid of the dog hous at the coolest temperature. In the experement, the black lid caus the insid of the jar to be at an a verag of 53(DEG)C and the white lid caus it to be an averag of 42(DEG) C. If the outsid wa black the dog hous would be too hot and if it is white the hous will be cool enough for the dog to live in.
27634	10	white :: The insid of the dog hous after be paint white might make the doghous be colder. In the data it sai trial 1 and next to white it sai 42(DEG)C. In trial 3 it had 41(DEG)C. The averag temperatur of white wa 42(DEG)C the lowest averag out of everi color.
27635	10	white :: The best paint color for the doghous is whit e becaus the temperatur is not too hot when put under light. Black woul d not be a suitabl color for the doghous becaus it averag temperatur e under a lamp for ten minut is 53(DEG)C ; which is too hot. White pai nt howev ha an averag of 42(DEG)C when put under a lamp for ten minu tes. Thi mean that with a white doghouse, the dog wouldn't over heat.
27636	10	dark grai :: The color grai would absorb onli some of the light eneri for heat, not as much as black and sinc dog have thick coa ts you dont want it to be too hot insid the doghouse. Also it get cold in the winter and Brandi and jerry' dog their build a hous for might not have a realli thick fur and it would be neccesari to be at 0least so mewhat warm in the doghouse. That why grai would be the best color.
27637	10	white :: Becaus in the summer, the white color will d eflect the sun' heat, keep the doghous 10(DEG) cooler than if you w ould paint it black, becaus in the experiment, the air temperatur insid e of the jar with the white lid stai in the low 40's, while the jar wit h the black lid stai in the low-mid 50's, prove the white deflect he at, while black asorb it.
27638	10	white :: the doghous will stai cooler on the inside.
27639	10	white :: the color white would effect the doghouse' i nside in a wai were it would absorb less heat theror it would be cooler in the insid of the dog house.
27640	10	black :: the darker color will keep most of the heat i n the dog hous than the color white would. the increas of the heat is b ecaus of the darker color in the dog house.
27641	10	white :: The paint color that i choos is white i cho se thi color becaus it will not make the insid of the dog hous as hot . The color might affect the insid of the dog hous becaus white doe n ot absorb as much heat as a darker color would. In the summer in stead of it get up to 53(DEG) C with black paint it will be a cooler 42(DEG) C with the white paint
27642	10	black :: The black paint will keep the dog warm insid the doghous dure winter, just like how the black jare lid heat the air in the jar 11(DEG)C higher than the jarwith a white lid.
27643	10	light grai :: the doghous wouldnt be too cold or too hot. i got thi data from the tabl thei made of all the adverag
27644	10	light grai :: The light grai is a good color to choos beca us it won't be too hot in the summer and won't be too cold in the winter . The light grai wa the 2nd coldest jar.
27645	10	white :: the color will keep the dog cooler and will n ot get the dog realli hot.In the expir it sai that it got down to 4 1(DEG)C.And the lowest for other wa 44(DEG)C.
27646	10	white :: The temperatur would be lower, becaus in the experi the white lid had a temperatur 11(DEG) below that of the bl ack lid
27647	10	white :: i think white becaaus white reflect the sun so it not as hot insid the dog house.
27648	10	white :: to keep the dog hous cooler a black dog hou e
27649	10	white :: becaus black attract more heat than white
27650	10	dark grai :: Becaus the result of their experi show d that a dark color attract more sunlight, it would be best to have a da rk grai paint. Although, dark color would be a veri bad idea for hot sun ny dai becaus it would becom extrem hot insid of the doghous and the dog would begin to dehydr and would have to have it' waterdish re fill two time a day. But, with a light grai paint on the doghouse, the dog would be abl to stai cool dure summertime!
27651	10	white :: the color white is the best choic becaus it will keep the doghous colder. A white jar kept the jar cooler by 11 deg rees.
27652	10	white :: thi color will affect the dog by keep the dog cool in the summer.becau the darker the lid color,th greater the i ncreas in air tempeture...
27653	10	light grai :: thi color would effect the dog hous by keep ing the air warm and cold so it would be the right temerature.
27654	10	white :: I would make it much cooler for the dog in hi s new dog house.
27655	10	white :: th white paint will keep the dog hous cool w hen it get hot outsid
27656	10	white :: The color white might affect the insid of th e dog hous to be cooler. The averag of the three trial for white wa l ower than the averag of the other colors,whit wa 3(DEG)c cooler than light grai and as much as 11(DEG)c cooler than the black.
27657	10	white :: becaus white draw the least amount of energ y
27658	10	dark grai :: The best color to paint the doghous would be dark gray, becaus dog hous ar usual meant to keep dog warm. Dark grai would absorb enough sunlight to make the insid warm, but not hot. Therefor the dog would be most comfort with the color dark gray.
27659	10	white :: If the doghous wa paint white, the insid of the doghous wouldn't get to hot for the dog. Thi is becaus i n the data tabl the averag temeratur for the light grai lid color wa 42(DEG) C. Also, if the doghous wa paint black or ani of the other c olors, the dog would possibl get to hot becaus thei ar darker color t hat absorb more energy.
27660	10	dark grai :: It will warm the doghouse, and help the dogho us contain a consist tempeture, at 54(DEG) C
27661	10	white :: White will keep the dog hous cooler becaus in the expira white had the lowest averag temperatur when it wa pu t under the light for 10 minutes.
27662	10	white :: I think the best paint color for the doghous is white. I believ that sinc white is the lighest color of paint thei have, it will keep the insid of the doghous cooler. The lighter the col or, the less heat it will asorb. In the data, the averag temperatur of the air insid the glass jar when the lid wa white wa 42(DEG)C. For bl ack, the darkest color lid thei had, the averag temperatur of the air w as 53(DEG)C. That' a total differ of 11(DEG)C.
27663	10	black :: the color black would keep the dog hous warm er.
27664	10	black :: Black is a good color to us becaus it absorb heat. It would make the insid of the dog hous warm, much like the hot lamp experiment. In the lab the lamp becam hot becaus the black lid absorb heat from the lamp. I think the black paint will absorb heat from the sun and make the dog hous warm inside.
27665	10	white :: thi color would be best becaus it would not get as hot as a darker color such as black make it better suit for the dog
27666	10	black :: it will make the dog hous warmer.
27667	10	light grai :: Thei should paint it light grai because, tha t color attract heat but not so much that it would get so hot in there i n the summer, and not too cold in the winter.
27668	10	dark grai :: thi color might affect the doghous by absor bing energi from the sun but you dont want black becaus you dont want it to hot for the dog.
27669	10	light grai :: it might make it look not as good but it will also be cooler becaus black let the heat in not out . it will also be lighter insid at night.
27670	10	black :: I would choos black for the paint color beca us the black paint would absorb the heat energi from the sun and heat up the insid of the doghouse. The black lid had an averag tempuratur of 53(DEG)C, which wa the highest averag tempuratur out of all the lids, and the white had a tempuratur of 42(DEG)C, which wa the lowest. Thei had a differ of 11(DEG)C, mean that the black paint would keep t he doghous warmer.
27671	10	white :: i sai white becaus is attrac less hot
27672	10	white :: The color white might affect the doghous becaus insid the doghous the temperatur will be lower than if us the paint color to be black.
27673	10	white :: white doe not absorb as much energi as the o ther color so the doghous would be colder inside.
27674	10	black :: i chose black becaus it will keep the hous warm becaus on the tabl it clearli state that black absorb more ener gy
27675	10	light grai :: when the dog hous get dirti it wont show th e part that ar dirti becaus it the color black
27676	10	light grai :: The light grai paint color would be the best becaus of the fact that if the dog wa in the dog hous it would not be too hot nor too cold. The data show that the averag tempreaur of the p ain is as follow Black:53(DEG)c Dark Grey:48(DEG)c Light Grey:45(DEG)c White:42(DEG)c so you see that with the ligth grei it still will absorb some light, so it wont be to hot or to cold in there... the light grei is a perfect inbewteen tempratur for the dog hous becaus to much heat for an anim is not good and so it to littl heat.
27677	10	dark grai :: dark grai wa the onli color that didn't eith er decreas or increas in temperatur dure the Hot Lamp experiment. If the built a dog hous dark grai the insid of the dog hous wouldn't ov r heat.
27678	10	white :: Thei should us white as a color becaus it w ill not be as hot in the dog hous than with a black dog house.Dark col or asborb energi and lighter color dont so white would be a good choice.
27679	10	white :: The color white would affect the doghous bet ter becaus the doghous will stai cooler.
27680	10	white :: It will keep it the coolest out of all the co lors. The temp for white wa 41 to 43 while the other colr were rang to 44 to 54(DEG)
27681	10	light grai :: I think that Light Grai would be best becaus it attrack some heat so dure the winter it will be warm. Then later, d ur the summer it will take in some heat but it won't take in enough to heat the dog up alot so he will stai at a pretti well kept temperature.
27682	10	white :: it will keep it cooler
27683	10	white :: White would be the best color for the doghou e becaus white absorb less energi which would make the doghous cooler for the dog. Accord to the experi the white color lid had an av rage air temperatur of 42(DEG) C while the black lid had an averag air temperatur of 53(DEG) C.
27684	10	white :: Brandi and Jerri should paint thier doghous white becaus the insid of the doghous will stai cool even dure the s ummer. the data show that the white lid averag heat tempertur wa abo ut 42 C and the black wa about 53 C. white wa 11 degre cooler.
27685	10	black :: with black paint the dog would have a warmer dog hose becaus black absorb heat. In the experi the temperatur fo r the black lid wa alwai the highest.
27686	10	black :: That color would provid the warmest environm ent for the dog in the doghouse, becaus the black paint would creat the warmest air temperature. In the experiment, the jar with the black lid r each an averag of 53(DEG), which wa 5(DEG) more than the next high st temperature. (48(DEG))
27687	10	black :: it would effect in the heat becaus it would be warmer
27688	10	white :: the white hous wouldb better becauseit refl ect light wai better than black becaus it absorb the light, caus it to get hotter
27689	10	white :: White would keep it cooler in the doghous lo nger.
27690	10	white :: It will let the dog cool down on a hot dai faster.
27691	10	white :: The averag temperatur from the glass jar experi for the color white wa 42 degrees. Thi is the lowest temperatur out of the four color (Black, Dark gray, Light grai and Whit e). Using the color White would reflect the sun heat, caus the doghous to be cool and not overheat. Therefore, creat a safe doghous habitat.
27692	10	black :: fdddfddf
27693	10	white :: the color will effect the dog hous by keep it cooler than the other color becaus in the expiri the white lid alwai had the lowest temperature.
27694	10	dark grai :: I believ that the dark grai would be a good paint color for the dog hous becaus depend on where thei live, that dog hous woudn't be too hot, nor cold
27695	10	light grai :: The Color Will Effect By Have Black And Whi te Mix Becaus Black Bring Heat And White Is Cool Color And Mix Them The Dog HoUSE Would Be Warm
27696	10	black :: After a while the doghous color might fade o ut.
27697	10	dark grai :: the color i chose till make the dog hous war m but not to hot and dark grai stai the same temperatur at 48 for all 4 trial
27698	10	dark grai :: when the heat stai the same outsid it will stai the same insid too.
27699	10	black :: Using black paint color on the dog hous will increas the temperatur insid the dog by a few degrees, make it more comfort for the dog.
27700	10	light grai :: The light grai might affect the doghous but not too much becaus the light grai is almost at about room temperature. If you put black in there, it will be too hot. If you put white in there it might be too cold.
27701	10	white :: By make the doghous white, the air insid the doghous would be cooler than with ani other color. In the experi Lid Color vs. Air Temperatur Inside Glass Jar, the jar with the white lid wa onli an averag of 42(DEG) C after 10 minut of heating. The jar with the black lid, however, wa an averag of 53(DEG) C after 10 minut es of heating. The jar with the white lid wa an averag of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefor, the color white will make the doghous cooler insid and is the best color for the doghouse.
27702	10	black :: it will make it hot in the dog hopus
27703	10	white :: The color white would make the dog hous absorb less heat and make it cooler. Acord to the experi black got 53(DEG)C and white got 42(DEG)C so it should do the same with the dog house.
27704	10	black :: i think balck so it willl keep it insol a nd warm for the dog
27705	10	"white :: I would choos black becaus in the ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperatur Inside Glass Jar"" Tabl It Show That Wh it wa Colder than black and The rest Of the darker colors. For exampl the averag for white wa 42(DEG)C and the averag for black wa 5 3(DEG)C."
27706	10	white :: i would pick a white dog hous becaus the white jar lid had the least amout of tempatur increase. it onli had about a an 18(DEG)C increes while the black jar lid had a 29(DEG) C increase.
27707	10	white :: white will reflect the heat so the dog hous will be cool
27708	10	white :: The white panit Becaus if you panit it a dak er color the result would be a hoter dog hous and the reslut for a whi te dog hous would be a cooler house.
27709	10	black :: how it can affect is that when is reallli hot outsid the dogshous can get realli warm or like hot caus the sun is absorb more energy.
27710	10	dark grai :: i think that brandi and jerri should us the color dark grai becaus if it summer and it realli hot then it wont be to hot for the dog and wen it winter the dog can still be worm inough be caus the air insid in a jar like it show in lid color vs. air temperat ur insid a glass jar the medium color that ar not to hot or to warm i s dark grai and light grai so eather of them is fine becaus u wouldnt wa nt the dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want it to hot
27711	10	white :: It will keep the doghous cool and not hot. W hen Brandi and Jerri put the white lid on, the averag temperatur insid the jar wa 42(DEG) C. When thei put the black jar on, the averag temp eratur wa 53(DEG) C.
27712	10	black :: black becaus the color black atrac the heat and it get reali hot.
27713	10	white :: If the doghous wa white the temperatur in the doghous would be so much cooler than if the doghous wa black. White would be best for the doghous becaus you would not want it to be too warm.Whit would fit the best.
27714	10	white :: white color will deflec more sunlight
27715	10	white :: White will not affect the doghous becaus in the result in the experiment, it show that white wa the lowest temper atur than all the temperatur of differ lid colors.
27716	10	black :: It will be warmer for the dog
27717	10	white :: White would be the best chois becaus it att ract less heat as shown in the experi the jar with the white lid onl y got up to 43(DEG)C at the highest, and the black lid got up to 54(DEG) C at the highest. And the dark grei and light grei were inbetween.
27718	10	white :: Paint the doghous white would make it cooler insid the doghouse. I know thi becaus the averag temperatur for the white-lid jar wa 42(DEG)C and the averag temperatur for the other color jar were all equal to or abov 45(DEG)C.
27719	10	white :: becaus it ha the least amount of air pressu re
27720	10	black :: paint your dog hous thi color will affec t the insid by make it hotter is what i get from the chart and the re ult the kid who did thi project.0
27721	10	light grai :: Light grai doesn't asorb as much heat as Blac k or Dark gray, which would help keep the doghous cool in the summer tim e. It also asorb some heat, at least more than white, which would help k eep the doghous from get too cold in the winter. Thi make it the o ptimal paint to us when design a doghouse.
27722	10	white :: it will keep the doghous cool.
27723	10	light grai :: If thei us light grei then the doghous will stai cooler becaus if the color of the paint is dark then it will absor b more heat as it did in the lamp experiment.
27724	10	white :: I think white becaus in the summer time the dog hous is not to hot for the dog hous and warm air can come insid the dog hous door to make the insid a littl wwarmer.
27725	10	white :: The color white would reflect the light on th e house, instead of absorb it like the black would, keep the hous cool inside.
27726	10	white :: the white on will reflect more heat than the other color
27727	10	black :: i would chose a black for the doghous beacu e the air temperatur would be hotter, therefor keep the dog warmer i n the winter time. i know thi becaus in brandi and jerry' experiment, when the lid wa black, the averag air temperatur wa 53(DEG) celsius, and when the lid wa white, the averag air temperatur wa 42(DEG) celcius,
27728	10	black :: Thei should us black paint for their doghou e. In the experiment, the iar insid the jar wa 5(DEG)C warmer than the second warmest color.Th jar with the black lid wa 53(DEG)C.
27729	10	white :: It would keep the doghous cool in the summer . after ten minut the jar with the white lid wa on average, onli 42(DEG) C. The jar with the black lid howev had an aver ag of 53(DEG)C after ten m inutes. Thi would be much too hot for the dog.
27730	10	black :: us black paint it will increas the tempat ur in the hous so that their dog will stai warm
27731	10	white :: the color white doe not absorb energi from the sun. the color will make the dog hous cooler instead of if you make the top black it will be as hot as an oven insid the dog house.
27732	10	dark grai :: my color is dark grai it might effect the insid becaus it gonna make it look scari in there
27733	10	black :: It would increas the temperatur of the dogh ouse, especi when close to light. Becaus darker color make more hea t. For ecample, when Brandi and Jerri were do the experi on the lid colo rs. Black had the highest amount of heat. Thi is mostli becaus it an energi transfer. When light hit darker colors, it turn in to th ermal and or heat energy.
27734	10	light grai :: Light grai could effect the tempatur of the doghous becaus draker color absorb more heat than light color do. If Brandi and Jerri were to paint the dog hous black, the hous would absor b too much heat sinc in the data the averag wa 53((DEG)C), if you cho se dark grai the averag tempatrur wa 48((DEG)C) which could still be too warm. If you chose light gray, it averag wa 45((DEG)C) which is r ight in the middl of be warm and cold and if you were to us white, t he averag wa 42((DEG)C) which could be too cold in the winter time. Th erefore, us the light grai could help keep the doghous warm and cool and the same time.
27735	10	light grai :: in the winter the dog might get cold so you m ak it a sort of light color so it can stai warmer. In the summer it will be hot and the dog will want to be cooler so you pick a sort of light co lor
27736	10	dark grai :: drak grai will not over heat the dog or chang e it temperatur
27737	10	light grai :: Light grai would atract more energi than whit e which would keep it warmer but it would also stai cooler than black or dark gray.
27738	10	light grai :: I think that the best color for a dog hous w ould probabl be light grey, that wai insid the dog hous wouldn't be to o hot or too cold. If the dog hous wa white, insid the dog hous would probabl be too cold sinc white doesn't absorb as much energy. I wouldn 't paint the dog hous black though becaus it might get too hot, same wi th dark grey. So light grei would be the best color for a dog house.
27739	10	white :: Sinc the color white' averag wa 42(DEG)C (the coolest temperature), it would be the best choice. Sinc white doesn't get as much heat, the dog in the doghous would be cooler than in a darker color doghouse.
27740	10	white :: Choos WHITE!!! becaus it won't absorb much heat like black doe 54(DEG) will make the dog hous too hot. White is g ood becaus it a nice 41(DEG)
27741	10	white :: becuas white gather less energi which will make it cooler insid than ani of the other colors.
27742	10	black :: Using black paint to paint a doghous would a bsorb more heat, as the data from the experi shows. In the experi , the jar with the black lid heat up to 53(DEG) on average, while whit e onli heat up to 42(DEG) on average.
27743	10	white :: white is the best choic of color becaus the averag temputr wa 42 so compar that to the black which is 53 the d og hous would be cooler with white pant
27744	10	white :: On the graph, white is the on that had the c oolest tempature, becaus the light went right through the color, so it d idn't get realli hot. As shown on the graph.
27745	10	white :: us a white color on the dog hous will dec rese the amound of heat come into the dog hou ther for it will k eep the dog hous more cooler then those darker color' thi is becous w hite absorb no color but it self
27746	10	black :: if you choos black then insid the dog hous will be veri hot becaus in the experiment, the darker the color, the mo re hot it got insid the jar becaus dark color absorb energy.
27747	10	black :: cuz will keep dog warm
27748	10	white :: it is to lite so it wouldent let of as much l ite.
27749	10	black :: black atract heat
27750	10	white :: keep it cool
27751	10	white :: White is the best choic sinc the highest te mperaur wa in the black jar at 54(DEG), and the lowest wa in the whit e jar at 43(DEG) show an 11(DEG) difference, keep the dog less ho t in hi house.
27752	10	dark grai :: becaus it can captur some sunlight
27753	10	white :: I think that the doghous should be paint white becaus the lighter color reflect more light energi than the dark. The averag temperatur of black lide jar wa 53(DEG). The averag of the white jar wa 42(DEG). The dog should live in a hous that wont absorb too much energi so thei wont overheat.
27754	10	white :: it wont be so hot
27755	10	white :: Thei should paint the doghous white becaus in the data it show that white wa alwai the coldest in everi trial an d if thei did black the dog would alwai be hot.
27756	10	light grai :: insid the doghous in the summer it will kee p it somewat cool and in the winter it will keep it somewat warm. also it wa (in my opinion) the central temperatur of them all be 45(DEG) C .
27757	10	white :: if thei made a white doghous the air tempatu re would not be as hot is if thei made the dog hous black becaus light r color absorb less light.
27758	10	dark grai :: It would keep it warm in the wonter and cold in the summer so the dog wouldn't be to hot or to cold.
27759	10	light grai :: thi color would keep the dog hous cool in t he summer and in the winter would still help heat the hous the hous wou ld be warmer if thw color wa black
27760	10	black :: The color might affect the insid tempatur of the doghous becaus the dark provd a type of cover that is like a insulation.
27761	10	white :: white would absorb less energi in the doghou e make it cooler insid the doghous
27762	10	light grai :: it will make it so it' nice and warm at nigh t but still ha enough heat retan at night to keep him/her warm
27763	10	black :: If the colori darker it will absorb energi
27764	10	black :: If you were to chose black as your paint colo r, it woul warmer than the dark gray, light grai and white. In thi exp riment black got about 53(DEG)C and the white got 42(DEG)C.
27765	10	light grai :: well if u have a darker color like black for an exampl it could be wai too hot in the mid-day, but if u have a light color like white for an exampl it would probabl be wai to cold at night so a light grai color would be the just right tempatur
27766	10	white :: Paint the doghous white would allow the d oghous to stai cooler in the summer so that the dog do not get too hot inside.
27767	10	light grai :: I chose light grai becaus dog' eyesight onl y contain black and white sight, thei dont see color like human do. So a light grai dog hous will catch dog attention.
27768	10	light grai :: Thi color will make the doghous stai cooler when it is warm and sunny, but it will also creat heat when it is cold.
27769	10	light grai :: Thi color can effect the doghous by keep it cool but to to cold and not to hot, becuas dark grai or black will o ver heat the dog, becaus of there fur.
27770	10	dark grai :: becaus it wasint the hotest or coldest tempi ture so it wouldent be to hot or cold in the dog hous it had steadi resu lt
27771	10	white :: The white color would let the insid of the doghous be cooler than the other type of paint becaus the white lid' averag temp. wa 42(DEG) C and the black lid' averag temp. wa 53(DEG) C. that is an 11(DEG) differ for the dog to feel.
27772	10	white :: becaus if you have a dark color the light wi ll make it hot for he dog.
27773	10	white :: The white paint color will reflect off heat a nd not absorb as much energi as the black paint which is a good paint col or for the summer. The white paint color averag for the temperatur is 4 2(DEG)C, while the black paint color averag for the temperatu is 53(DEG) C.
27774	10	black :: Might affect the doghous look nice for the d og
27775	10	white :: it wouldn't heat up so fast
27776	10	black :: I chose the color black for the doghous beca us from the data collected, black wa warmer than ani other color with a n averag temperatur of 53(DEG)C compar to the lowest temperatur of 42(DEG)C for the color white. The dog in the hous will stai warmer beca us black is the warmest color which I know by look at the data Brandi and Jerri collected.
27777	10	dark grai :: i think that dark grai could be the color bec aus it woulld not be to cold or to hot. So in the summer the dog hous c ould stai cool, and in the winter it could stai warm.
27778	10	light grai :: I chose light grai becaus it will keep the i nside of the doghous from be 2 warm if thei live in an extremel y hot place. The averag temperatur of the jar in the light grai jar wa 45(DEG)C. So it is enough to keep the dog warm, but not enough to make it uncomfortable.
27779	10	white :: White reflect energi instead of absorb it like other colors. It also had the lowest air temperatur insid in the jar of all three lids. Thi would make the doghous cooler insid and more comfort for the dog inside.
27780	10	white :: white becaus after 10 minut of heat it get s to about 42(DEG) C and dog should have cool temperature, not hot.
27781	10	dark grai :: becaus it will keep the dog hous warm
27782	10	light grai :: the dog hous can eather be hot or cold so th er isn't much of a differ in the heat amount in the dog house.
27783	10	light grai :: The light grai color I think would be the be t color to paint the dog hous becaus the light grai color would absorb some heat eneri to keep the dog warm but would also keep the dog cooler t han black or dark grai and warmer than the white. From the experi the light grai lid had an averag temperatur of 45(DEG)C while the blac k lid had an averag temperatur of 53(DEG)C and the dark grai lid had a n averag temperatur of 48(DEG)C. The white lid had an averag temperat ur of 42(DEG)C. The white color would keep the dog cool but the white c olor would reflect most of the heat energi which would in turn no make th e doghous warm when needed.
27784	10	light grai :: the light grei soak up heat but not too much .
27785	10	white :: thi color might affect the dog hous by not get that much air inside. white ha the lowest averag tempetur whic h is 42(DEG)C
27786	10	white :: I chose white becaus it would make it for a cooler hous for the dog. Acord to the data tabl shown, it sai that the white lid will produc less heat than the other colors.
27787	10	white :: i beliv white will work the best becaus it doesnt conduct as much heat as the orther on s did: for exsample:b lack,drak grey,light gray, all got imbetween 44 and 54 well while the whi te paint onli got 42-41 and 42 as an aveag
27788	10	black :: If Brandi and Jerri pick the black roof then the insid of the doghous is go to be hotter than if thei were to pic k the dark grey, light grei or white roof. In the expirement, when Brandi and Jerri us the black lid, the temperatur got up to 54(DEG)c and wi th the dark grei lid, it onli got up to 48(DEG)c, with the light grei l id, the tempertatur got up to 46(DEG)c, and with the white lid, the tem peratur onli got up to 43(DEG)c, so most like the black roof would ma ke the insid of the dog hous hot.
27789	10	black :: A black roof will keep the doghous warm.Th averag temperatur of the black lid wa 53(DEG)C, but the averag for t he next highest color wa 48(DEG)C. Therefore, a black roof will keep th e dog at least 5(DEG)C warmer than ani other color.
27790	10	dark grai :: Dark grei would keep it to a cool temperature, but not too cold, and not too warm. Which is good for a dog.
27791	10	white :: I chose white becuas it' the coolest and dog have a lot of fur, so then thei can escap the sun in a shady, cool dog house.Ther wa quit a big differ between black which got up to 54 degre C and white who highest wa 43. In the winter thei will have a big fur coat , so thei won't need it warm insid their dog house, plu there isn't as much sun. If it too cold thei can go insid the house.
27792	10	black :: becaus it increas the engeri
27793	10	white :: thi color might affect the doghous by makin g it more ditri and reflect off of the wall and see light come from everi where.
27794	10	white :: so you can see the dog in it hous
27795	10	light grai :: I think Light Grai would be the best paint co lor becaus it' not go to make the dog hous that hot but you also do n't want it to be to cold so it' a comfort temperature.Light G rai averag about 45(DEG) C while white averag 42(DEG) C,Dark Grai a t 48(DEG) C, and Black at 53(DEG) C.
27796	10	light grai :: It will keep the dog warm but not as hot as u sing Black or Dark Grei paint, The averag temp for Black is 53(DEG) and the averag for the Light Grei paint is 45(DEG) an 8(DEG) difference.
27797	10	white :: thei dog hous would be cooler and not ha ho t as a black or darker color dog hous would be make it better to be in on a hot dai
27798	10	black :: Black is the best color to choos becaus in the experiment, it said that the black lid attract the most heat so the y should us black paint to trap heat in the doghous for the dog.
27799	10	black :: It would make the doghouse' temperatur rise .
27800	10	white :: White paint would effect the dog hous becau e the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed. Accord to the data , the differ in temperatur would be around 11 degree Centigrad th en the black colour. So the white colour would absorb less heat result in a less hot doghouse.
27801	10	dark grai :: Dark grai is the best choic becaus it not to hot and it not to cold. The averag temptur is 48(DEG)c and the oth er ar 53,45 and 42
27802	10	black :: black would ceep the hous warm wene the uv r ai hit it thei colect all the energi wich is in other word heat
27803	10	white :: white would work good caus that wai the dogh ous wont get to hot and it would be more comfortable.
27804	10	white :: The best color to paint a dog hous would be white becuas white reflect heat from the sun which caus the dog hous to becom cooler in temperature. My support to my statement is in trial 1 The white white lid jar wa the least in temperatur becuas the white lid jar wa 42(DEG)C and the Light grai lid jar wa 44(DEG)C and the Dark Grai lid jar wa 48(DEG)C and the Black lid jar wa 54(DEG)C also in all the other trial the wjite lid jar wa cooler i n temperatur then the diffrent color lid jars. So Brandi and Jerri sh ould pick White to color there dog hous if thei want the dog hous to be cooler in temperatur so there dog wouldn't get too hot and die.
27805	10	white :: the white color will be much cooler then the other color because, in the experi the darker color made the insid of the jar hotter. but the white color hade the lowest tempertur which would be the ideal color for a dog house.
27806	10	dark grai :: The best paint color for the doghous would b e dark gray. Thi color mai affect the insid of the doghous becaus it would either keep it warmer or cooler, depend on the weather. The resu lt from the experi sai that the dark grai lid made the jar 48(DEG) C. in ten minutes, so it would keep the doghous warm. It realli just dep end on the climat of where the dog live.
27807	10	light grai :: I pick light grai becaus I think the black and dark grai doghous would absorb too much energi and make it too hot for a dog to be in. Wherea the light grai doghous won't be too hot or t oo cold.
27808	10	white :: White would be the best color becaus when it is summer and it get hot the insid will be cool becaus black absorb sun while white reflex sun
27809	10	dark grai :: if there is dirt in the dog hous it would be hard to see it
27810	10	white :: By choos a white color for the dog hous i t will keep the dog cooler. I know thi becaus in the experi t he averag temperatur in the jar with a black lid wa 53, but the averag e temperatur in the jar with a white lid wa 42. Therefor the darker th e paint color the warmer the dog house.
27811	10	white :: The best color for the doghous would be whit e, becaus it absorb less energi than a black color, and the black lid a verag wa 53(DEG) C and the white lid wa 42(DEG) C.
27812	10	white :: The color white will effect the dog hous bec aus the white paint will reflect more white then black paint would. So t he white doghous will be cooler in temerature.
27813	10	white :: it would be much cooler than if it wa black
27814	10	white :: White color doesn't absorb as much light as b lack. Black color get hotter by direct sunlight becaus it is abosorb it while white color simpli reflect the light so it stai at about the s am temperature.
27815	10	light grai :: the light grai color might prevent it from be ing either too cold or to hot. Also in the results, the color grai wa the s econd to least heat of them all.
27816	10	white :: it will make the dog hous cooler than if you us black paint becaus white paint doesnt absorb that much energi
27817	10	white :: The dog hous will be cooler if paint White and more comfort for a dog. In the experi the temperatur for the jars(in (DEG)C) with the black lid were 53, dark gei 48, light grei 45, and white 42. The White wa 11(DEG)C less than the hottest jar (Black)
27818	10	white :: white becaus it doesnt absorb as much heat a s black
27819	10	light grai :: the color of the paint on the doghous will a ffect it in mani ways. to begin with, it will chang the temperatur of t he doghouse. if the doghous were black, then it would absorb alot of the energi radiat from the sun. becaus darker color hold heat more. the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse. make the temp eratur cooler then if it were paint darker. the dark grei is go to keep it warm, but not as hot as the black paint would. and the light grei would keep it cooler, but not as cool as the white would. so it would al l depend on were you lived. and what temperatur best suit your pet. th e darker color ar go to absorb more of the heat. and the lighter col or ar go to reflect more of it off. i would choos light grei for my doghous though. becaus it would keep more of the heat off but it would also keep it warmer then just have it be white.
27820	10	dark grai :: If i were to paint a dog hous the color i wo uld choos would be dark grey.Becaus black would absorb to much heat dur ing the hot days.And white would absorb no heat so dure cold night the dog hous would be veri cold.And dark grei is just in the middl so it do es not get to hot or to cold.
27821	10	dark grai :: Dark grai is the best color to paint a doghou se with for mani reasons. One reason is that in the result of their exp riment drak grai had the same temperatur all 3 trial time and same aver ag of 48(DEG)C thi ment that dark grai is a good color for a doghous becaus it will absorb the right amount of energi in order for the doghou se to maintain at the right temperature. Dark grayi not a too dark color but not a too light color either.
27822	10	black :: The color black will make the doghous warmer . Thi is becuas in the experi the averag temperatur for the Black Lid wa 53(DEG) C compar to the White Lid at the averag of 42(DEG) C. Thi show that the darker the color the warmer the object/doghous wi ll be becaus it obsorb more heat.
27823	10	light grai :: I chose light grai becaus it is the perfect temperature. It' averag temperature, 45(DEG) C, is a veri good tempera ture; not too hot and not too cold. If you paint the doghous taht clour, it will be warm, but onli slightly. It would protect the dog from swelt ring heat; but keep it from freezing.
27824	10	light grai :: If the doghous were to be light gray, the air temperatur wouldn't be too low, but not too high. The averag temperatur of light grai compar to the averag of black is 8(DEG) while the differ between light grai and white is 3(DEG). Thi way, light grai would be perfect as an in-between.
27825	10	white :: the dog well be more comfit in the dog ho use.
27826	10	light grai :: I chose light grai becaus it doesn't attract a whole lot of heat like if you were to us black but attract more heat then white does. Inside the doghous in the winter would be nice becaus it would attract some heat to be warm in the winter. In the summer it wou ld be warmer then winter becaus there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much as if the color of the doghous wa black. Another reaso n why I chose light wa it had an averag temp of 45(DEG)c warmer than w hite averag temp of 42(DEG)c.
27827	10	white :: I think that white would be the best color be caus in the data thei had the lowest temputur so it would be the cold t for the dog.
27828	10	white :: White is the best color to choos becaus it reflect the sun' rai better than ani other color. and it wont make the insid get to hot
27829	10	white :: White will not attract the light as much as a ny of the oth colors, therefor allow the dog to stai cool.
27830	10	light grai :: Color the doghous light grai could keep t he temperatur insid the doghous at a cool averag of 45(DEG)C, which is the averag temperatur insid the glass jar for the lid color vs. air temperatur insid glass jar experiment.
27831	10	white :: the best color would be white becaus the in id of the doghous would be cooler becaus the color white atract less heat energi then the other color becaus the result show that white had lower temperatur than the other color
27832	10	dark grai :: brandi and jerri should us dark grai becaus it would be a comfert temperatur for the dog at 48(DEG)c, wich the data sai is it' averag
27833	10	light grai :: It wold keep it warmer in the winter and cool er in the summer. The medium shade color is a fantast wai to keep a pet warm!
27834	10	white :: becaus it will stai the coolest and the dog wont like it in there if it cold
27835	10	white :: so the dog hous doesent heat up as fast in t he summer so the dog can stai in hi hous longer
27836	10	light grai :: The color would affect the doghous becaus d arker color absorb more light energy. So light grei would absorb some bu t not alot keep the insid of the doghous cool and not realli hot (45 (DEG))
27837	10	light grai :: it will be the right temp for a dog
27838	10	dark grai :: I would choos Dark Grai becaus it will not absorb as much light as black would, but it still is a dark color to abso rb some light. Thi would affect the insid temperatur of the doghous b ecaus it won't be to cold nor to hot in the doghouse. Compar my choic e to the expir When thei us Black as the lid color it gave the hot est insid air temperature. Dark grai wa in 2cnd place with a temperatur e of 48(DEG) C, but I thought 45(DEG)C for the light grai would be to c old.
27839	10	white :: Paint the doghous white would affect it b ecaus in the summer, the doghous would be cooler. In the experiment, th e white lid had the lowest temperatur of 42(DEG)C while the pther were much higher.
27840	10	white :: I chose to paint the doghous the color white base off of Brandi and Jerry' experi results. In the experiment, w hen thei test the lid color black, the averag temperatur insid the j ar wa 53(DEG)C. Thi wa the highest temperatur out of the color and the temperatur rais by 29(DEG). Meanwhile, the white lid had an avera ge temperatur of 42(DEG)C, therefor have the lowest temperatur aver age. Thi time, the temperatur rais onli 18(DEG) after ten minutes. C ompar to the black lid, the white lid rais to a temperatur and had a chang from the origin temperatur of 11(DEG) less. Ultimately, I cho se to paint the doghous white to keep the temperatur the coolest. White had the lowest averag temperatur of 42(DEG)C and would keep ani dog n ic and cool.
27841	10	dark grai :: i sai dark grai becaus it keep the doghous warm enough so that if it' cold outside, and it doesn't get it too hot for a sunni dai outside. it' a 50/50 type thing warm enough and not too cold.
27842	10	white :: Black: Averag temperatur wa 53(DEG) Dark Gray: Averag temperatur wa 48(DEG) Light Gray: Averag temperatur wa 45(DEG) White: Averag temperatur wa 42(DEG) Becaus of the cool temperatures, I would ch oos white as the doghous color. With black, the doghous would be prett y hot and uncomfort for the dog.
27843	10	white :: White would be the best color to have for a d og hous becaus it' temperatur would keep the dog hous the coolest. I n the experi the white color jar had an averag of 42(DEG)C, so th at wa the best choic and the worst choic wa black. The black color jar had an averag of 53(DEG)C, so that wa the worst choic becau se it could be to hot for the dog.
27844	10	white :: it will keep it from be to hot in the summ er
27845	10	light grai :: It mai affect the dog hous becaus if it to o hot then the dog will get too hot and if it too cold the dog would fre ez so if it not too hot and not too cold the dog hous will be good for the dog year around.
27846	10	dark grai :: Thi color will make the doghous on tempera ture and not mani differ temperatures. In the experi the dark grai lid stai at 48(DEG)C.
27847	10	black :: If you would paint a doghous you would want your dog to be warm, so paint the doghous black would keep him or her warm.
27848	10	white :: The color might affect the doghous becaus t he darker the color is the hotter it is insid and the lighter the color the cooler it is inside. For exampl when test the blakc got 53(DEG)c, the dark grai got 48(DEG)c, the light grai got 45(DEG)c, and the white got 42(DEG)c. you see as the color increas from darkto light,th temp atur decreases.
27849	10	white :: I would choos the color white for the color of the doghous because, it will make the insid of the dog hous cooler for the dog so that dure hot summer dai the dog can stai cool and not super hot. The reason why thi would work is shown on the trial board. Wh il there wa a black lid on a jar the averag temperatur of insid of j ar after 10 minut wa 53(DEG)C When there wa a white lid on the jar the averag temperatur of the jar wa 42(DEG)C. That is a 11(DEG) differ between the two lids. SO if you want the doghous to be cold r for the dog you'd want to get a white doghouse.
27850	10	black :: Black, becaus if black had the most heat averag mayb it might have the most heat averag for ther dog house.
27851	10	white :: it cant be black becaus black obsorb light. which would increas the temp, and white reflect light so that is why w hite kept the doghous cooler at an average.
27852	10	black :: If thei were to us a black paint it would de finet increas the dog hous air tempature. Accordinq to the data the color black had an averag of 52(DEG)c. after ten minut of the experi ment, unlik the other lighter color which had lower averag tempatur .
27853	10	white :: The data tabl show that the white lid jar t ook in the least heat. The black lid jar took in an averag of 53(DEG)C after 10 minut under the lamp. The white lid jar onli took in an averag e of 42(DEG)C. Thi is why the doghous should be paint white to keep most of the heat out.
27854	10	dark grai :: If the doghous were dark gray, it might aff ct the insid temperatur of the doghouse. Heat is attract to darker ob jects, so it would be warmer, but not as warm as it would be black. The d ata from the experi show that the black lid on averag wa 53(DEG)C , the dark grai lid wa 48(DEG)C, the light grai wa 45(DEG)C, and the white wa 42(DEG)C.
27855	10	black :: the color black could affect the temperatur in the dog hous becaus the color black can attract light and heat sinc the color black is an absenc of light.
27856	10	white :: Brandi and Jerri should paint the doghous white becaus then the insid of the doghous would stai cool and comfort for the dog to be insid it when it' sunni outside. I know thi becaus in the investig when the lamp wa heat a glass jar with a black lid, the air temperatur insid the jar wa an averag of 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes, but when the lamp wa heat a glass jar with a white lid , the air temperatur insid the jar wa an averag of 42(DEG)C after 10 minutes. So, if the doghous wa paint white the temperatur would be cooler.
27857	10	light grai :: it will affect the doghous by it be cool r then heat temperatur get attract to it.
27858	10	white :: White would keep the doghous cooler in the s ummer becaus it reflect more light wave than it absorbs. In their test Brandi and Jerri found that white kept the jar the coolest
27859	10	white :: The white color paint will protect the doghou se from heat becaus it isn't as dark. From the experi it show that a darker object store more energi caus it to heat up in air temperatu re.
27860	10	white :: becaus the darker the lid color,th greater the increas in air temperatur in the glass jar, becaus darker color absorb more energy.
27861	10	dark grai :: It will keep the dog hous insid warm in col d weather yet cool in hot weather.
27862	10	white :: Have white would make the insid temp. cooler becaus in the experi the jar with the white lid had the coolest averag temperatur of 42(DEG)C.
27863	10	light grai :: light grai becaus when it is warm, the dog will want to stai cool and when the weather is cold the dog will want to stai warm. The result got higher and lower, for example, the first trial wa 44 it increas by hte second trial.
27864	10	black :: black is a darker coler, if you were to were a white shirt appos to a black on on a hot dai you will be warmer in t he black shirt becaus it absorb more energy.
27865	10	white :: the color white becaus it wont attract as much energi or haet if it were darcker
27866	10	light grai :: Thi color might affect the dog hous by maki ng it kind of cool and not so hot for the dog becaus it is not as dark a s black so it won't absorb a lot of energi but also it is not as light as white so it won't be too cold
27867	10	white :: it would affect the doghous becaus white i s cooler than the dark colors. the averag for white wa 42 while the averag for black wa 53.
27868	10	white :: If the doghous is somewher warm, it should be white to keep it as cool as possibl insid the doghouse.
27869	10	black :: The black paint would insul the insid of the dog hous and keep it warm. The color black reflect heat. In the exp eriment black had the highest averag tempertur of 53(DEG) over all the other test colors.
27870	10	light grai :: T wai thi color might affect the insid of t he doghous by not be to hot becaus the darker the lid color,th grea ter the increas in the air temperatur amd becaus light grai is onli 45 (DEG)C.
27871	10	white :: I would us white becaus it is the coolest color and it wont over heat the dog as bad unlik the other colors.
27872	10	black :: If Brandi and Jerri chose Black, it would kee p the dog hous the warmest out of the four color
27873	10	white :: it would keep the dog/ dog hous the coolest on the inside. so it wouldnt get too hot. where if you paint it black i t would get much warmer in there.
27874	10	white :: I would us white to paint my dog hous becaus it would make it colder insid for the dog. In the experi the white len test to stai the coldest insid the jar so the white paint on the dog hous would make it so the dog hous wa colder for the dog.
27875	10	dark grai :: Thei might want to choos dark grai becaus i t will make the doghous not too hot as black and not too cold as white f or it will still obsorb heat and make the doghous warm like the jar temp eratur stai the same at 48(DEG)C after heated. So the dog would stai more and obtain the same amount of temperatur the whole time when heat d most like and not have to chang around to differ temperatures.
27876	10	white :: it will affect the insid of the doghous by make it cooler in it. it show it wa 42(DEG) and that cooler than a ll the other color
27877	10	white :: the dog need warmth
27878	10	black :: it will effect the dog hous is by the color of the paint and the temperoture. also it will effect it is becaus how dark is the paint.
27879	10	black :: If it were to be cold outside, the black on t he doghous should make it warmer.
27880	10	black :: The black would absorb the most thermal energi caus the dog hous to have a higher air tempatur (get warmer).
27881	10	white :: white will make it so that the dog hous will be cooler for the dog
27882	10	white :: The white color attrack less heat so that wa y the dog isn't to hot or to cold
27883	10	black :: The color black will affect the insid of the doghous becaus the darker the color, the greater the increas in air t emperature. In the result of the hot lamp experiment, the black air tem peratur got the highest averag with 53(DEG)C .Thi is becaus dark co lor absorb more energy.
27884	10	light grai :: light grai so the doghous wont be so hot .
27885	10	black :: Well in cold temperatur like in the experi you would want your dog to have a warm sleep area so you would choos black in the winter becaus that color absorb the most heat keep the doghous warm. If it wa the summer time you might want to us white or light grai to keep the hous cool.
27886	10	dark grai :: i would us dark grei becaus (base of were i live) it colder most of the year but it hot dure summer so that wai when the dog is insid dure winter it warm and dure summer it not too hot
27887	10	white :: White will keep the dog hous cooler insid b ecaus it the lightest (brightest) color up there and in the experi it show that the over all averag of the black (darkest color) wa 53 de gree C and the averag color for the white lid wa 42 degre C. Therfor e make white the coldest color possibl for the dog house.
27888	10	black :: By paint the doghous black, Brandi and Jerri will be allow more heat to be attract to the doghouse. The data tabl from the experi prove thi point becaus it show that the averag temperatur insid the glass jar after 10 minut while us the black lid wa 53(DEG) C, which is the highest averag temperatur of the four lid color that were us in the experiment.
27889	10	black :: black might effect the dog hous by keep i t warmer becaus black attact heat , it asorb the heat .
27890	10	light grai :: Thi wai the insid of the doghous won't be too hot or too cold. The averag temperatur wa 45(DEG). White would be too cold becaus the averag temperatur wa 42(DEG). Black would be to o hot becaus the averag temperatur wa 53(DEG).
27891	10	white :: it will make it not as warm
27892	10	white :: beacus white reflect the sun so it would st ay cooler
27893	10	white :: i chose white becaus it a veri bright, chee rful and an eleg color and the dog won't get realli hot like he would in black or dark gray.
27894	10	white :: I think that the best paint color for the dog hous is White. I pick thi color becaus white doesnt affect the insid e of the hous with a lot of heat. So it would stai cool dure the summ r time for a dog. Becaus if you paint it balck, sens black attract the sun it would attract more energi and have more of the hott sun go in the dog house.
27895	10	light grai :: I chose Light Grai becaus if you put black i t might be too hot becaus the trial where the averga wa 53(DEG)c. F or dark grai it mai also get to hot hot becaus the averag wa 48(DEG)c . Light grai wa 45(DEG)c and that just perfect it wont be to cold or to hot. White mai be to cold at 42(DEG)c.
27896	10	white :: White' (color of paint) affect on the doghou se will be that the doghous will take longer to heat up. So in the summ r, the dog will be abl to stai cooler, longer. I know thi becaus in th e experiment, the white jar lid heat up the least of the four color by atleast 2(DEG) C each trial.
27897	10	black :: i chose black becuas that mean the dog hou e would be warmer on the inside, i know that becaus the averag temperat ur of black after ten minut is 53 degre while the averag temperatur e of white after ten minut is 42 degrees.
27898	10	white :: Have a white doghous would keep the insid mof the doghous cooler. The averag tempatur for the insid of the jar with the white lid wa 42(DEG), while the insid of the jar with the bl ack lid wa an averag of 53(DEG). The dog hous would be on averag 11(DEG) cooler.
27899	10	light grai :: Sinc the darker color were to hot and the l ighter color were to cold the light grai wa kind of the middl so the d og wont be to cold or to hot
27900	10	white :: You would choos white becaus instead of ab orb the sun light like black paint the white paint reflect it which w ould make the dog hous more cool.
27901	10	white :: The color that would be best for the doghous in the SUMMER would be white. In the experi with the effect of colo r on temperature, the black lid caus the greatest increas in temperatu re, rise from 24(DEG) C to an averag of 53(DEG) C. But the white lid caus the least increas in temperature, rise from 24(DEG) C to onli 42(DEG) C. So if Brandi and Jerri want to keep the insid of the doghou se cool in the summer, thei should choos to paint the outsid of the dog hous white, as it provid the least increas in temperature.
27902	10	white :: A white dog hous would make it cooler insid . From the data the averag temperatur for white wa 42(DEG)C which wa cooler then the other colors.
27903	10	white :: it will effect the dog hous by absorb le s heat energi keep the dog hous cool,evid frome the tabl state the averag temp. for white is 42 celsius.
27904	10	white :: I think thei should paint the dog hous white becaus when there is a dark color such as black it will absorb the he at so it best to us white so it wont be as hot in the dog house.
27905	10	white :: The color white will reflect more of the sunl ight. Wich will make the hous a colder temperature.Whit wa the coldest temperatur in the expirement.It averag wa 42(DEG) wich wa the low st temperatur and black had the highest temperatur wich wa 53(DEG) as an average.
27906	10	white :: well...if thei were try to make the doghou se nice and cool,thei should us white.th color white reflect everythin g off of it make it a perfect doghous to stai cool in.it block about 30% more heat than a black dog house.
27907	10	white :: the white light will make the dog hous have light in it.
27908	10	black :: i think black becuas it wa the highest numb er on the averag it wa 53.
27909	10	light grai :: Brandi and Jerri should paint the doghous li ght gray. Light grai will keep the doghous not too warm but not too cold . In the experi the light grai lid let in an averag of 45(DEG)C. Th e black lid let in an averag of 53(DEG)C. The least heat let in wa the white lid with an averag of 42(DEG)C. If i chose the white lid, the do g might be too cold insid hi house. With black paint, the dog could be too hot insid hi house.
27910	10	light grai :: The best color for a doghous might be Light grai becaus it wouldnt be to cold and it wouldn't be to hot. In the data it show that the averag temperatur for the light grai lid wa 45(DEG) c and the other were 53, 48, and 42(DEG)c
27911	10	light grai :: i like that color so i chose that color.
27912	10	dark grai :: Dark grei becaus black is probabl to hot an d white is probabl to cold, but dark grei is right in the middle. It wil l keep the dog warm.
27913	10	light grai :: Thi color wa the in between color, or middl e color. It wa not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretti good balance, so for trial 1 it wa 44(DEG)c for trial 2 it wa 45(DEG)c, for 3 it w as 46(DEG)C and for trial 4 it wa back to 45(DEG)C. Thi is the best c olor, sinc it will keep the dog warm, but not too warm and not to cold e ither.
27914	10	dark grai :: I think the be color would be dark grai becaus it not the darkest and the darkest color absorb more heat. It not the lightest so it wont be veri cold.
27915	10	white :: Thi color might affect the insid of the dog hous becaus in Jerri and Brandi' experiment, white wa prove to be t he coolest (in degrees) color. Versu black becaus the black lid attract ed MORE light.
27916	10	white :: reduc tempertur
27917	10	light grai :: I chose the color light grei becaus with sun the temperatur insid the dog hous will be around 45(DEG) and t hat is not to hot and not to cold for the dog.
27918	10	white :: white is the best color for the dog hous bec aus dark color absorb more energi than light colors. With white paint i nside the dog hous it' go to be cool and cold rather than with dark color paint insid the dog hous it' go to be hot. In the experi dark color lid attrak more heat and the air wa hotter than with the light color lid that why white color paint will be a better color for t he dog hous so it stai cooler.
27919	10	white :: it willb cooler then the other color for th e dog hous
27920	10	light grai :: Light grai might keep the dog hous warm in t he winter yet cool in the summer becaus in the expiri light grai att rect heat ,but not alot of heat.
27921	10	white :: well sinc the color is light grai instead of dark grai or black, it wont absorb as much heat, make a cool place to stai on a hot summer day. If it wa light grai it wouldent be so ba d etheir but white sound like the best option. Thse fact ar true becaus the experi s how that a black lid did absorb more heat, while the other not so much.
27922	10	dark grai :: A dark grai might make the insid of th e dog hous hot. Becaus darker color absorb more heat energy. That woul d keep the dog hous warmer at night,So that why I pick dark gray. I a lso pick it becaus it will not absorb to much energy.
27923	10	white :: white doghous would be nice and cool in it
27924	10	white :: Becaus the color white reflect thelight and heat better, in order to keep the doghous cool it should be paint whi te. Thi will make the doghous cooler inside, especi dure the summ er.
27925	10	light grai :: Brandi and Jerri should paint the doghous li ght grey, becaus then, the light of the doghous would keep the temp eratur down, and then tint of dark would keep it mildli warm.
27926	10	white :: it would reflect the heat and keep the insid cool
27927	10	white :: the white color will make the doghous cooler in the summer by reflect the light
27928	10	dark grai :: I think that Brandi and Jerri should us the dark grai paint becaus that wai the insid of the dog hous is cool for the dog when it hot outsid unlik the three other paint color that will attract the sun and make it hot insid the dog house, and also the dog wont have troubl sleep becaus the light wont realli reflect into the dog hous to bother the dog while try to sleep.
27929	10	white :: White is the lightest color there fore it wil l attract the least amount of heat.
27930	10	white :: white ha more energi it cooler and black and all the other color ar darker then white. The darker color ar closer togeth so thei do not let as much light in
27931	10	light grai :: The color ''light gray'' would be good for th e dog house, becaus when it is hot the doghous wont be that hot inside. Other than blak nd drack gray.
27932	10	white :: If it is white then the dog hous will stai c ooler and the dog wont over heat.
27933	10	light grai :: becaus thei probabl dont want it to be to hot or to cold so if thei us dark grai then it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog. the temp would have an averag temp of 45(DEG) not to hot not to cold.
27934	10	dark grai :: If Brandi and Jerri choos dark grai for thei r dog hous then the dog hous would be a littl bit cooler than a black dog hous but won't be cold like a white dog house. Therefor the dog wou ld be comfort be in a cool, but at the same time warm doghouse.
27935	10	white :: dog hous ar to protect and SHADE the dog a nd white doe not attract heat
27936	10	white :: A white paint doghous would make the inter nal tempertur cooler becaus as the experi ha shown, the averag in ternal air tempertur of the jar with a white lid wa 42(DEG), while the other lid caus averag tempertur rang from 45(DEG) - 53(DEG).
27937	10	black :: Paint a doghous black would help heat the house. From the experiment, black made the air temperatur rise th e most.
27938	10	white :: The color white might affect the doghous bec uas dure summer month it will not absorb as much ehat energi as a bla ck doghous would. although in the winter month you will want more of th at energi abosrb so it is suggest to repaint the doghous dure the wi nter months.
27939	10	white :: becaus white doesnt absorb heat becaus it not an dark color.
27940	10	light grai :: Light grei paint would keep the doghous a mu tual temprature. With a light grei color paint on the doghous the hou se wouldnt be to hot on a sunni dai like a darker color would make it. An d on a cold dai the dog hous wouldnt be to cold with a light grei paint.
27941	10	white :: Thi color will make the doghous cooler so t he dog will be more comfort in the hot sun. Accord to the experim nt the white-color lid had the coolest of temperatur out of all the 4 lids. It wa 42(DEG) in the white lid for trial on and 54(DEG) for th e black lid on trial one.
27942	10	black :: Choos the color black will affect the dogh ous becaus dark color absorb more energi
27943	10	dark grai :: i would paint the dog hous dark gray, thi w ay the dog hous is warm in the winter but not to hot in the summer.
27944	10	dark grai :: The color Dark Grai would affect the tempatur of the doghous because, as the data shows, a darker color result in hotter tempatures. The data show that the averag tematur wa 53(DEG) C for black, which would be to hot for a dog house. The Dark Grai however, had a lower tempatur of 48(DEG) C, which would be the correct tempatur to keep a dog warm, but not hot.
27945	10	dark grai :: if it' a hot dai the dog hous won't get too hot and if it' a cold dai the dog hous wont get too cold. the averag tempatur for the jar with the dark grai lid under the lamp is 45(DEG) C
27946	10	white :: thi color wouldnt make it as hot insid the dog hous as paint it black becaus as it show in thi experi darker color get hot faster, the black heat up to 53(DEG) and the white onli heat up to 42(DEG)
27947	10	light grai :: The color light grai might affect the doghou e by balanc out the temperatur of the air outsid or around the dogho use. Thi also might be the most comforat temp for the dog. Since, in Brandi &amp; Jerri' investigation,aft be place under a lamp for 1 0 minutes,th air temperatur insid of the light grai lid jar wa 45 deg ree celcius. While the other color lid jar temperatur in degre ce lsiu were: White-42, Dark Gray-48, &amp; Black-53.So, a light grai dogho us would be 8 degre celsiu cooler then a black doghouse,In which I wo uld assum to be a more comforat temperature.
27948	10	light grai :: I think that light grei would be a good color for a doghous becaus thi color would make the doghous not too hot an d not too cold. Accord to the lid experi light grei had averag tempertur of 44-46 compar to the black averag of 52-54 and the white averag of 41-43. The averag for the light grei lid ar moder coo l which would be a good choic for a dog so thei don't overheat or freez .
27949	10	white :: white would be the less warm when the sun or heat is shine directli at it than ani other choic
27950	10	black :: brandi and jerri should paint the dog hous b lack becaus the dog hous will be warmer the the other color caus blac k will absorb the sun most. accord to the data if you paint the doghous black it will be warmer then if you paint it white becaus blac k got an averag of 53(DEG) and white got an averag of 42(DEG). so the re for black will be best color if you want it to be warm inside.
27951	10	white :: The lighter the color, the less heat that col or will attract/absorb
27952	10	white :: White will keep the insid of the dog hous c ooler. The averag temperatur for white wa 42(DEG)C after 10 min ut which is 3 less degre than the second coolest color, grey, at 45(DEG) C
27953	10	white :: Becaus the other take in the light more th an the white paint
27954	10	white :: White would have a lower temperatur insid t he doghouse, Make it nice and cool for the dog.
27955	10	white :: If you chose to paint the doghous white than it would be cool insid for your dog to rest in/cool off on hot summer d ays. White would decreas the temperatur of the dog hous becaus in the Air- Temperatur experiment, the color black (the darkest lid) had the h ighest avg. temperatur insid of the glass jar which wa 53 C. the lightest color of lid (white) had t he lowest avg. temperatur insid of the glass jar and it wa 42 C. The differ between the dark lid (black) and the light lid (white) wa s 11 C. So therefor the lighter the color in thi case white, will attra ct the least amount of sun result in a low temperature.
27956	10	white :: If Brandi and Jerri paint the doghous whit e, then the light would reflect off he dog house. If thei ppaint it bla ck then the light would be absorb and it would get veri hot insid and (if temperatur get hot enough) possibl even burn or catch on fire.
27957	10	light grai :: The white mai be best becaus it is the coll st color (tempurature) as shown in the chart and will make sure the dog doe not get overh while in the house.
27958	10	light grai :: light grai willl be the best color becaus it wil absorb some heat but also keep the dog from get to hot in the su mmer.Th tempertur where around 45(DEG)c which is good for a dog
27959	10	white :: That color will absorb the least amount of li ght keep the dog hous cooler
27960	10	white :: White will keep your dog hous cooler on the insid rather than us a dark color like black becaus that will attrac t more heat.
27961	10	dark grai :: The color dark grei would be the best color to paint the dog house. The color dark grei will affect the insid of the dog hous by make it warmer but not as hot as the black. I know thi becaus the averag of the black in the experi is 53(DEG) C and the averag temperatur for dark grei is 48(DEG) C
27962	10	black :: black might effect the dog hous becaus in t he chart black ha the highest temperatur of all color
27963	10	white :: Using white paint for the doghous will keep it cooler. In the experiment, the jar with the black lid had an averag t emperatur of 53(DEG)C and the jar with the white lid had an averag tem peratur of 42(DEG)C. The jar with the white lid wa an averag of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid.
27964	10	light grai :: Light grei would keep the doghous cooler in the summer, but will also will absorb more light than white, so it will b e warmer in the winter.
27965	10	white :: White would be a good color to paint the dog hous becaus in the trial white had the cooler temperature.
27966	10	dark grai :: I would choos light grai becaus it would keep the dog nice and cool dure dai and warm at night . also depend on where thei live.
27967	10	black :: Black would make the insid of the doghous w arm becaus the darker color abosorb the heat from the sunlight. So if Brandi and Jerri us the color black for the lid of the glass jar then t he lid would absorb more of the heat from the bulb. If Brandi and Jerri u sed the color white for the lid then the lid wouldn't absorb much of the heat from the bulb.
27968	10	black :: It will keep the hous warmer in the winter. The balck lid had a averag temperatur of 53(DEG)C and the Dark grai ha d the averag of 48(DEG)C. The Light grai had an averag of 45(DEG)C an d the white had an averag of 42(DEG)C. Therefor, the black color roof is the best.
27969	10	black :: Black be the color of the doghous might affect it by make it warmer (higher temperature) becaus it absorb more light energy. In the results, the temperatur wa 53(DEG)C while with the white lid wa onli 42(DEG)C, show that black result in the highest temperatur (wa the warmest).
27970	10	light grai :: it would make it so it' not too hot, but not too cold either.
27971	10	dark grai :: The best paint for it will be the dark grai b ecaus darker color absorb more energy.
27972	10	white :: White would chang the temperatur insid the doghous becaus the lighter the color or the darker the color the cool r or hotter the air will be insid the doghouse. So if the doghous wa w hite the air temperatur will be cooler than the black air temperatur do ghouse. I know that dog like cooler air better than hotter air
27973	10	light grai :: if it is black then it will get hotter insin un like grai it wont
27974	10	white :: If Brandi and Jerri were to paint the dog hou se white, it would keep it cooler. When thei did the lid experment, the a verag for the darker lid wa highest (53(DEG)C). If thei were to paint the dog hous a darker color it would becom hotter quicker. The averag for the white paint wa 42(DEG) C so it prove that paint the dog hou se a lighter color will keep it cooler.
27975	10	dark grai :: I think dark grai is the best coler becaus i n the winter it will not be so cold becaus it will get some of the sun a nd heat up, and also in the summer it would not be so hot from the sun, s o the dog could alwai be in his/her dog hous ani time of year.
27976	10	black :: The black paint would keep the insid of the doghous warmer than the other color of paint. The averag temperatur o f the glass jar with the black lid wa 53(DEG)C. The averag temperatur of the glass jar with the white lid wa 42(DEG)C. The jar with the blac k paint wa 11(DEG)C warmer than the jar with the white lid.
27977	10	black :: If thei were to choos black for their paint color, thei would find that the dog hous would attract more heat becaus that what darker color do; attract heat.
27978	10	white :: Thei should us the color white becaus the c olor white doesnt attract heat veri well so therefor it would keep it co oler insid of the dog house, the result show that in all the trial whi te wa in the low 40's, and all the other color like light grei an d black were in the high 40' and low 50's. Therefor the dog hous would be cooler with white paint.
27979	10	black :: Using black with attract more sun and it woul d be hotter insid the doghous and hot to touch so unless you like it wa rm I would light gray.
27980	10	white :: I think white becaus the insid will be cool er as shown in the experiment. The white lid' highest temperatur in the experi wa 43(DEG) where as the black highest temperatur wa 54(DEG) , which prove the white is cooler.
27981	10	white :: I choos white ,thi mite affect the dog hou e by make cooler in hot weather. I choos thi becaus in the experimen t white had the coolest temperatur
27982	10	white :: If Brandi and Jerri piant the dog hous whi te, then in the sun light the dog hous will stai to an averag of about 40-45(DEG)C becaus the color white deflect the sun light awai off of t he dog house.
27983	10	white :: It will stai cool and if it wa black it woul d be to hot for the dog.
27984	10	black :: the darker the color the warmer the dog hous is go to be beacus dark color obsorb more light then other color
27985	10	white :: thi color would be good for a dog becaus if the dog need to cool off the white color attrack less heat. i know thi s becaus the averag temperatur for black wa 53(DEG), for dark grai i t wa 48(DEG), for light grai it wa 45(DEG) and for white it wa 42(DEG) therefor white attrack less heat
27986	10	dark grai :: I would chose Dark Grai becaus in the summer it would be nice and cool and in the winter it wouldnt freez. The avreg temp. is 48(DEG), though out all the trials.
27987	10	white :: becaus not absorb much energi thi color.
27988	10	white :: Brandi and Jerri should paint the doghous white becaus the affect on the doghous is that the color white will keep the insid of the doghous cooler then if Brandi and Jerri paint the doghous black. Thi is becaus black absorb more energy, caus the insid of the doghous to be warmer and white reflect (energy) light so it'l l keep the insid of the doghous cooler. From the experiment, when a black lid wa used, the tempatur insid the glass jar wa 48(DEG) C but wh en a white lid wa used, the tempatur insid the glass jar wa 42(DEG) C. So as you can see the lighter the color of the lid, the cooler the tempatur insid the glass jar will be and the darker the color of the lid, the warmer the tempatur insid the glass jar will be.
27989	10	light grai :: becaus it had 5 more then dark grai
27990	10	light grai :: I chose light gray, becaus the insid of the doghous will not be too hot or too cold if light grai wa chosen. I learn in Brandi and Jerry' expira that the darker the color of the lid was, the warmer the air temperatur insid the jar wa (after 10 minutes). If the dog hous wa light gray, the dog will be comfort warm.
27991	10	white :: it wil keep the sun from hit him
27992	10	white :: thai should choos white becus it attract l ess heat so the dog can stai cooler
27993	10	black :: It will ABSORB HEAT BECAUSE BLACKABSORBS HEAT
27994	10	white :: Thei should choos white becaus accord to the data the white had the lowest temperatur averag of 42(DEG)c and i t wa the lighest color. If thei chose black the dog hous would be too h ot. i know thi becaus black ha the highest temeratur average(53(DEG) c).
27995	10	white :: Becaus hot and the black made the jar 53.25(DEG) (on average) while the white onli made it 42(DEG) on average. Make white th e better choice.
27996	10	white :: it would absorb less heat so the dog would b e cooler than with black paint.
27997	10	black :: The averagr air temp in the jar wa 53(DEG)
27998	10	white :: The color white is the best paint color for t he doghous becaus it will keep the insid of the doghous cool. White a verag at 42(DEG)C after 10minut while black wa 53(DEG)C, prove t hat the white color paint will keep the doghous cooler.
27999	10	black :: Black would be the best color if Brandi and Jerri live in a cold area becaus black obsorb heat more than ani other color. Accord to thier experi the black lid had the highest temperature.
28000	10	black :: Black paint would keep the insid of the dogh ous warm. Black wa 11(DEG),8(DEG),and 5(DEG) more than the white,lig ht gray,and dark grai paints.
28001	10	black :: The color black attrack more Thermal Energ y than the other colors.
28002	10	light grai :: i chose light grai becaus the doghous would be a littl warm and a littl fresh therefor the dog wouldnt be as hot on a sunni dai or as cold on a raini dai
28003	10	white :: Thi color will affect the dog hous becaus it will keep it cool when it' hot outsid instead of be realli hot in side of the dog' hous becaus it stai the coolest.
28004	10	light grai :: so it wont be too cool or too hot
28005	10	light grai :: if you ar gonna paint a doghous paint it light grai becaus the result of the exper show that the darker the color the higher the tempatur and you dont want it to hot but you want it a littl warm so you would paint it light gray.
28006	10	white :: White will keep the doghous cooler and your dog get overh and sick.
28007	10	light grai :: The dog hous would be cold but for the dog w hich would have fur it would be warm and refreshingli cold so it would no t freez and it would not over heat.
28008	10	white :: Black will make the doghous warmer becaus b lack attract the light.
28009	10	black :: It would make the doghous much warmer as see n in the jar experiment.
28010	10	white :: it whould be cooler insid the doghous
28011	10	dark grai :: The dark grei paint would keep the doghous w arm when it' cold out, but not as hot as the black paint when it' warm out. The dark grei paint got the insid of a glass jar to 48(DEG)i n direct light in just ten minutes, so it should keep the doghous at a reason temperature.
28012	10	white :: White reflect the sun rai
28013	10	white :: Sinc dog have fur, thei dont need to be ani warmer so thei should paint the dog hous a lighter color. the black color wa 53(DEG)c and the white wa 42(DEG)c make the white colo le ss like to becom hot
28014	10	black :: in the data tabl it show the black paint wi ll keep the doghous the warmest because,black obsorb more sunlight than dark gray, light grai or white paint
28015	10	black :: the color black will effect the dog hous mor e becaus of the more energi it observ the tempetur goe higher
28016	10	white :: the doghous would be build to cool off the dog so if you paint the doghous white then the doghous would absorb less heat therefor keep the dog cool off.
28017	10	white :: white would be a good color for the dog hous becaus a dog can get veri hot dure the summer so the insid of the do ghous will stai cool. in the experi the white color lid had an av rage temperatur of 42(DEG)C when the black lid had an averag temperatu re of 53(DEG) C. Also out of the 4 color the air in the glass jar with the white lid wa the coolest
28018	10	black :: black would obsorb the heat and keep the dog hous warm in the experi in trial on the temperatur wa 54(DEG)c c ompar to the color white wich wa 42(DEG)c the temperatur wa a big j ump from black and white.
28019	10	white :: It will keep the dog cooler becaus it wa th e least warmest in the jar.
28020	10	white :: If thei paint the dog hous white, it would s tai cooler compair to the black
28021	10	white :: have white paint would make the dog hous c older so in the summer the dog would not be hot. The averag for white is the coolest tempatur (42(DEG))
28022	10	light grai :: I think that light grai is a good color becau se when it' sunni and hot outside, the darker color will make the dogho us veri warm and most like uncomfort for the dog. I didn't choos white becaus although it' not a huge difference, light grai wa still a littl bit warmer than white without be too hot.
28023	10	light grai :: the insid wont be hot and it wont be veri co ld either. the light grai averag temperatur had an averag of 45(DEG)C unlik the black lid which got hotter and had an averag temperatur of 53(DEG)C.
28024	10	light grai :: I think that the best color to paint the dog hous would be light grai becaus if you paint it black or dark grai then in the summer it will get too hot insid the dog house. But if you paint it white then it will get too cold in the dog hous in the winter so I t hink that light grai is the perfect color to paint the dog house.
28025	10	black :: base on the result in the experi if the y paint the doghous black it would keep the air temetur insid the do ghous the highest wich would keep the dog the warmest.
28026	10	white :: If the doghous is white the doghous will be cooler on the insid and therefor much more comfort on the inside.
28027	10	dark grai :: The black color might affect the doghous in a good way, becaus it will keep the doghous warm when it is sunni outside. And the dog won't be cold it will be warm.
28028	10	white :: Brandi and jerri should paint the the doghou e the color white. Thi color will affect the insid of the dogh ous becaus it will absorb less heat and make the insid of the doghous cooler than if you us a dark color becau light color absorb less ener gy. Evidenc from Brandi and Jerry' Hot lamp exp eriment show that the darker the color of the lid, the warmer the air i nside the jar was. So if thei plan to have a live anim insid e (in thi case a dog) I think it'd be more comfort if the doghous w asn't hot, thei should paint the dog hous white.
28029	10	white :: White is the best choos for the dog hous be caus it will stai cooler the the other color
28030	10	black :: Brandi and Jerri should paint the doghous bl ack becaus in the data tabl thei got result which show for trial on thei got 54(DEG), trial two 52(DEG), trial three 54(DEG), and the adv erag thei got wa 53(DEG). So thei should paint the doghous black beca us it will stai warmer insid becaus the sun is attract to the color black.
28031	10	white :: I think it wont affect the doghous becaus i t is white and I dont think it well attract the sun as much as the black color well.
28032	10	white :: If you design a white doghous the chanc ar e that the doghous would be more cooler then the black, dark gray,light grai doghous becaus the darker the color the more energi it will absor b. See beacaus when thei did the experi the black lid absorb more energi then all the other becaus of it' drak color, and the white lid absorb less energi then the other becaus it' lighter color.
28033	10	black :: If Brandi and Jerri paint their dog hous black it would absorb more energi from the sun and be warmer inside. I know thi becaus in their experi the jar with the black lid had the highest air temperature. The averag temperatur of the jar with the black lid wa 53(DEG)C which is higher than the dark grai (48(DEG)C), the light grai (45(DEG)C), and the white (42(DEG)C)
28034	10	black :: The black paint would affect the doghouse, be caus it would absorb heat and insul the doghouse, make it hot.
28035	10	light grai :: Brandi and jerri should paint the doghous li ght grai becaus in the summer time it will keep the insid of the doghou se cooler then the black and dark grei but a littl warmer then the white .
28036	10	black :: us the black color for the dog hous will make the dog hous warmer becaus on the data of the lid color vs. Air tempatur insid glass jar. the black lid made the jar 11 degre warmer than the white jar at 42(DEG) s so therefor the doghous will be warmer with the black paint.
28037	10	black :: black becaus in the experi it show that black keep heat in more
28038	10	white :: The best paint color for the doghous would b e white. In the experi white had an averag of 42(DEG)C wich wu the lowest temperatur out of the four colors. White would keep the doghous cool.
28039	10	light grai :: light grei so it disn't get too hot in the su mer and not too cold in the winter.
28040	10	black :: Black would probubl affect the doghous becaus it would absorb more heat. Plu the experi show that black kept in the most heat.
28041	10	white :: white is the best color becaus in the expera ment the white color lid wa the least on to atrack heat and wa the l owest in tempeture.
28042	10	white :: If thei paint the doghous white then the tem peratrur insid will be alot cooloer becuas the white lid wa 11(DEG) cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefor paint the doho us white would keep the dog nice and cool
28043	10	black :: it would affect the doghous by alwai keep it warm, becaus black ha more pigment in it so it absorb the light more. and in the investig the averag for black wa 53, the highest out of the rest, so that my prove that it would make it warmer/hot.
28044	10	white :: if you us white the tem in the dog hous wou ld be less
28045	10	white :: the insid of the dog hous wont be so hot be caus white paint wouldnt absorb alot of heat energi
28046	10	dark grai :: The insid of the dog hous would be moderatl y warm with dark grai at 48(DEG)c, Black would make it hot at 50(DEG)c, light grai would make it cool at 45(DEG)c, and white would keep it cold at 42(DEG)c.
28047	10	dark grai :: I believ that the doghous should be dark grai becaus not onli the temperatur from the experiment, but also the suitabl condit for a dog. Accord to the data the averag temperatur is at 48(DEG)C while the color black is at 53(DEG)C. For a dog to live in a doghous the temperatur shouldn't be too hot or too cold.
28048	10	dark grai :: If the color is dark grei for the doghous th an it would keep the dog warmer dure harsh weather yet not too warm for veri warm seasons. In the investig Hot Lamp, the lid color that inc reas the insid temperatur the most wa the black color lid with an averag temperatur of 53(DEG) C, howev the second highest wa the dar k grei lid with an averag of 48(DEG) C. So, the dark grei roof would be the perfect color for the house, to keep the dog at a comfort temper ture.
28049	10	black :: Becaus , The darker the lid color , the grea ter the increas in the air temperatur in the glass jar.
28050	10	dark grai :: The best paint color would be dark grai becau se it keep heat insid the dog hous becaus of the color and when it w arm out it wont be too hot to stai in for the dog.
28051	10	black :: I believ that the best color for the doghou e is black. Thi color mai affect the insid of the doghous by increasin g it temprature, therefore, the dog can stai warm. I know thi is true b ecaus the averag heat in the experi for black wa 53 degrees, while the averag tempratur with white, for example, wa 42 degrees. Clearly, black would be the best color for the doghouse.
28052	10	white :: white would be a good color for the doghous becaus the white will not absorb heat and the dog will have cool place t o go dure the summer or hot days.
28053	10	light grai :: light grai becaus it is not that hot o r that cold and it ha a okai average.
28054	10	white :: White is the best choic becaus when thei did the test with the lamp, the white lid wa the coolest with an averag t emperatur of 42(DEG)c. The black lid wa 53(DEG)c, the dark grai lid w as 48(DEG)c, and the light grai lid wa 45(DEG)c. If thei us black as the doghous colour then the dog might get to hot if he/sh stai in there to long. If thei us dark grai for the dog hous then he will have more time to get out of the dog hous befor heat up but he still can heat up. If thei us light grai for the colour of the dog hous then the dog will still have more time to get out of the dog hous than if the us black or dark grai but he still ha the chanc of over heating. If thei us white as the dog hous colour then the dog will have the most amount of time to get out befor he/sh over heats.
28055	10	dark grai :: if thei chose dark grey, the averag temperat ur would be 48(DEG) which is normal so the dog hous wouldnt be so hot for the dog, but cozi and not as cold either.
28056	10	light grai :: i would go with the light grai becaus grai k eep heat in but not to much heat and grai let the cold air out when it cold out side
28057	10	light grai :: u waant on that will keep u worm in the winter but cool in the summer
28058	10	white :: brandi and jerri should paint the dog hous w hite becaus than the dog can stai cooler in the summer time
28059	10	white :: If thei us white paint for the doghouse, the hous won't be too hot for the dog, becaus dure the experi thei found out that the darker the color, the more energi it absorbes.
28060	10	white :: The color is go to effect the dog hous by make the hous fresh becaus dark color consum more tempeture.
28061	10	black :: the color might affect the dog hous becaus the darker the color is the warmer the dog hous would be. In the experim ent hot lamp, the darker the lid wa the warmer the air got insid the ja r. when the lid wa black the tempatur wa at 53(DEG)(C) and when the w hite lid wa on the tempatur decreas to 42(DEG)(C).
28062	10	white :: white becaus the white get less heat than t he other colors. black got an averag of 53(DEG)c. the dark grai got an averag of 48(DEG)c. and light grai got an averag of 45(DEG)c. but the white got an averag of 42(DEG)c. so it should be white.
28063	10	white :: it white becaus white would keep the dog hou se coler than all the other coior
28064	10	dark grai :: The color might affect the insid of the dog hous becaus the averag temperatur is 48(DEG)C , and in trial 1 ,2 ,a nd 3 the temperatur wa 48(DEG)C also .
28065	10	black :: A black dog hous will hold heat better than anyoth color.I know thi becaus in the lid experi black' air temp atur had the highest averag out of dark grei light grei and white.
28066	10	black :: black is the best at captur and keep he at. it averag heat wa 53
28067	10	black :: With a darker color dure the winter the dog wouldn't be as cold. With black the averag tempretur would be 53(DEG) C. The diffrenc between White and Black wa 12(DEG) C hotter in the black jar then the white jar.
28068	10	white :: White would effect the insid of the dog hou e becaus white clearli kept the air temperatur insid of the glass jar in the experi cooler than black, dark gray, or light gray. The averag e temperatur of the jar with the white lid wa 42(DEG)C while the avera ge for the black lid wa 53(DEG)C. That is a differ of 11(DEG). Alt hough the dark grai lid and the light grai lid didn't have such an extrem e differ from the white lid, the dark and light grai lid still rose t he air temperatur quit a lot from the start temperatur which wa 24 (DEG)C. Also on averag the black lid rose the air temperatur in the gl ass contain 29(DEG)C from the start temperatur while the white lid onli rose the air temperatur 18(DEG)C from the start temperatur on average. That is a differ of agian 11(DEG)C.
28069	10	white :: If Brandi and Jerri us white, the dog hous wont be as hot, or higher temperature, becaus white attract the LEAST a mount of heat.
28070	10	white :: I think that white would be the color becaus accord to the experiment, white had the lowest temperatur so the dog s wouldn't get to hot.
28071	10	black :: it will give it more air and light for the dog
28072	10	white :: It might affect it becaus the darker the col or the hotter it is
28073	10	light grai :: I chose light grai becaus sai it a realli c old dai outside, and your dog is insid hi doghouse. Ill bet he realli happi that you didnt chose to paint it white instead.
28074	10	light grai :: if you choos cark grei the insid of the dar k hous wont be to warm or to cold. when you us black it had an averag of 53 degre becaus the dark is absorb all of the heat. the whi te on the other hand is 42 degre adn isnt absorb as much of the warm ness. you would nt want the doghous to be to warm or to hot so if you ch os light the dog could have a perfect tempetur , becasu he alreadi ha a thick fur line keep him warm and we would want him to becom so war m and becom faint. so light grai wch collect 42 degre on an averga i s better
28075	10	white :: I chose white becaus the color white doe not absorb as much heat as black so the white would keep the dog cool when it is hot.
28076	10	light grai :: thei like it becus thei like dog house'
28077	10	black :: if brandi and jerri increas the darker the doghouse(black) then the doghous will be a lot hotter becaus the darker the dog hous the more energi is absorbed.
28078	10	white :: Base on the data white will make the dog hous cooler. Light color don't absorb as much heat as dark colors. In conclus white would be the best color for the hot weather.
28079	10	black :: Acorrd the expirement, the black lid on th e jar caus the temperatur insid the jar to be higher, therefor makin g a black-paint doghous have warmer temperatur than other colors.
28080	10	light grai :: Light grai is the best color for a doghous b ecaus a black dog hous is too hot for the dog, be 53(DEG)C on avera ge. The white doghous would be too cold from onli have 42(DEG)C insid e. The onli option left ar dark grai and light gray, but with the heat come off from the dog itself, more heat will circul around the doghouse. Therefore, light gray, with 45(DEG) C on average, would be a better color to paint a doghous than dark gray, with 48(DEG)C on average.
28081	10	white :: If it is white then the air in the dog hous will stai cool on hot days.
28082	10	white :: thei should us white becaus the averag tem peratur of white wa 42(DEG)C, and the averag temp of black wa 53(DEG) C. Therefore, the color white would keep the dog coolest.
28083	10	dark grai :: A dark grai dog hous would keep the doghous warm but not too hot in the sun. In the experi the jar with the dark grai lid didn't have the hottest or the coldest air inside.
28084	10	white :: le color se be ma bonito que lo otros.
28085	10	white :: The color white will keep awai the heat on ho t summer dai keep the doghous cool.
28086	10	"dark grai :: The color dark grai will affect the doghous by make the doghous warm. Not too hot in the summer and not too cold i n the winter. The data tabl on ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperatur Insid e Glass Jar"" sai that the averag temperatur for dark grai lid is 48(DEG)C. Thi show that it is a good temperatur for most weather."
28087	10	white :: thi will make the doghous the coolest beca ue it' averag data wa onli 42 degre C. Thi will keep the dog the co olest dure the summer time
28088	10	black :: The color of the doghous be black will be st maintain heat dure cold season or period of time. Dure the hott r seasons, the dog occupi the hous will have no need of the doghouse. Thus, overh is not an issue.
28089	10	black :: black is not a good color bacaus it exstract s heat from the sun and and the trial for black ar 54 52 54 53 and that s why thei should not choos the color black.
28090	10	white :: White will keep the insid of the dog hous colder dure the summer or when it hot outside. The averag for white is 42(DEG) instead of black be 53(DEG).
28091	10	white :: because, it will keep you more warmer.
28092	10	white :: white would make the dog hous colder
28093	10	white :: the color white would be the best for the dog hous becaus white absorb the least energi and would keep the doghous cool and comfort
28094	10	light grai :: the light grai color will keep a maintain normal temperatur
28095	10	white :: I would paint it white so on a hot summer dai Brandi and Jerry' dog could cool down.
28096	10	black :: Thi color will affect the doghous intern temperature. The dark of the color will absorb heat energi and keep the insid of thi dog hous warm.
28097	10	black :: becu is black
28098	10	white :: the white paint would make the doghous cool r.the black paint would make the doghous warmer at 53 degre celicus. t he white paint would be 42degre celcius.
28099	10	white :: it will make the dog hous cool for the dog o n hot days.
28100	10	black :: beacus it can be warm insid the dog hous i f the sun hit the black paint it can be hot in there and chang the temp atur
28101	10	black :: el negro por que el negro consum el calor y el blanco no
28102	10	white :: White would be the best color becaus the tem peratur in the insid of the dog hous would be colder than ani other co lor
28103	10	white :: The dog hous should be paint white becaus it would make the dog hous the coolest (coldest). Sinc dog like the s hade and cold to cool them down in the summer, white would reflect the mo st light energi and prevent it from becom too hot. After ten min utes, the jar with the black lid heat up by 29 degre C on average. Ho wever, the jar with the white lid didn't heat up at all on average.
28104	10	black :: Have a black doghous will b warmer.
28105	10	white :: white is the best color becaus it keep it v eri cool, lighter color like white reflex the sun lite that make it mo re cool and darker coolor like black absord that make it more hot
28106	10	light grai :: i pick light grai becuas i thought i didnt want the dog to be to hot in there by have it black or dark grai but t hen again i didnt want the dig to have white just in case he wont get to cold so i pick light grai so he/sh will feel just right
28107	10	white :: I would choos White color paint becaus the dog hous would be cooler accord to the result in the expiri where black wa for the first trial , 54(DEG)C, then for the last trial also 54(DEG)C. Where as White at it first trial got 42(DEG)C and 41(DEG)C for it last trial
28108	10	light grai :: Sinc the doghous will have a live be in it, the temperatur should be comfort for the dog. 53(DEG) C is very, veri warm and would make a dog uncomfortable, especi on a warm su mmer day. But, 41(DEG) C is too cold for a dog in the winter time, as thi would be a year-round hous for the dog. So, 45(DEG) C would be less hot in the summer, and more warm in the winter, which is just perfect for the dog.
28109	10	white :: it wont exorb that much heat so it will cool insiod the dog hous
28110	10	white :: White will keep the doghous at a cooler temp eratur than ani of the other color will, thu prevent the dog from o ver heating. Thi is proven by the fact that after ten minutes, a jar wit h a white lid had an increas temperatur of 18(DEG)C, while jar with darker lid (rang from light grai to black) had an increas in tempera ture of anywher from 21(DEG)C to 29(DEG)C. The white lid kept the jar cooler, so it will keep the doghous cooler as well. Thi is healthier fo r the dog.
28111	10	black :: the color black would effect the air tempatur of the dog hous becaus in the scenario it sai darker color absorb more energy.
28112	10	black :: If you paint the outsid of a dog-house, th en the insid would be warmer. No matter what color you paint the insid e.
28113	10	white :: white would be the best color to chose for th e doghouse, becaus white reflect off the sun. It doesnt absorb it like black, dark grey, or grey.
28114	10	dark grai :: The best paint color for a doghous would be dark grai becaus it close to median of the data. Also, the averag temperatur for dark grai is 48(DEG)C, thi show that the color can a bsorb and reflect light, so in cold dai the doghous will stai warm and on hot dai the temperatur insid the doghous will be cooler.
28115	10	dark grai :: it will keep the temperatur the same at all time
28116	10	white :: The white paint would help keep the dog hous cooler when it is hot out. From the experiment, the white lid wa the co olest out of all four lids.
28117	10	white :: White will keep the doghous cool becuas it reflect light instead of absorb it
28118	10	white :: White will make the dog hous cooler on the insid unlik black. White had a averag of 42(DEG)c and black wa 53(DEG) c.
28119	10	light grai :: Light Grai wa the color I would have chosen for the insid of the doghous because, sinc black absorb the most ener gy and the insid would have been hot. Dark Grai would have done the same thing as Black but just not as much energi would have been absorbed. Lig ht Grai would have been a perfect color, not onli absorb the perfect a mount of the light the insid would not have been as hot as the color B lack and Dark Grey.
28120	10	light grai :: As shown in experi that Brandi and Jerri conducted, we learn that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs. Know this, we wouldn't want the dog to get overheated, so we would panint the dog hous the lightest color available. Which in thi case, is white. Though, the dog, be a live creatur shouldn't get too cold, therefore, light grai is the perfect compromise. Keep the dog wa rm enough, but not too hot.
28121	10	black :: Thi color black, could affect the doghous b ecaus the dog could get veri hot in the Summer time. Also, the doghous might get extrem hot from the sun and start to erode.
28122	10	dark grai :: i chose dark grai becaus it stai the same heat everi trial so it wouldnt be to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter
28123	10	white :: Dur the experiment, Brandi and Jerri foun d out that white wa the color that least affect the air temperatur in the jar when a lamp wa direct toward it. If the white color wa paint ed apon the top of the dog house, then the temperatur wouldnt rise as mu ch as the black coor paint because, jerri and Brandi made there experim ent and got the result of white have the least affect air temperatur e when a lamp is direct at the jar. For example, on Trial 1, the white contain had an air temperatur of 42(DEG)C versi the air temperatur in the black jar of 54(DEG)c.
28124	10	light grai :: it cool but it get some heat for the dog
28125	10	white :: It Go To Be Cooler For The Dog In The In id Than The Darker Color Becaus thei do absorb more energi and that wi ll make the doghous veri hot in the inside.
28126	10	light grai :: light grai could affect the insid of the dog hous caus the color is not to dark so that it wont be to hot and it n ot to light so it wont be to cold the temperatur will be just fine.
28127	10	white :: it will keep the doghous cooler than ani of the other color becuas it stai in a termperatur of low 40(DEG)C. li ght grai wa in high mid 40(DEG)C, dark grai in high 40(DEG)C, and blac k wa in low 50(DEG)C prove that lighter color keep the air temperatu re cooler
28128	10	light grai :: I pick dark grai becaus in the experi it result have darker color absorb some heat. So that mean lighter color help reflect. Light grai help absorb heat in the winter just a l ittle, and in the some help reflect a good amount.
28129	10	black :: thei should make the dog hous black so that it will keep the dog warmer in the winter becuas more heat will be absorbed. The black lid wa an averag of 5(DEG) warmer then the second warmest color so the dog will stai nice and warm insid the dog hous
28130	10	light grai :: The tempatur of the dog hous would be from 44(DEG)C to 46(DEG)C. The dog hous will be at a neutral condit beca us it will not be too hot or too cold
28131	10	light grai :: I choos dark grai becaus the light grei is perfect.sai that it a could wet day.th dog is realli could. the dog cou ld go into the dog hous and stai warm with out be over welm with he at from hi bodi and fur. the color' averg tempurtur wa 48 degre ce lceas.it keep most of the temp in but leav some out. also it gragulla y wa get warm at a slow pace.wich would help the dog alot when it ge ts to summer time so he dosnt get over heated,bui the sun heat
28132	10	dark grai :: Dark grai is better becaus it will get hott r in the doghous but not too hot.
28133	10	white :: the heat would be less atract to white than the rest of the colour
28134	10	white :: it wont make it as hot it'll make it cooler
