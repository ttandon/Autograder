1673	1	the procedures i think they should have included in order for me to replicate the experiment would be how different samples did they used for each what tool did they use to determine the mass .
1674	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many ml of vinegar they used how much distilled water to rinse the samples with and how they obtained the mass of each sample .
1675	1	in order to replicate their experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into each of the containers as well as what kind of samples we are going to measure . it should state specifically marble limestone wood and plastic . it should also tell us on what the rocks samples will sit on as different materials may compromise the results . the last thing that would be needed to replicate this experiment is to tell us what kind of containers the samples should be put in such as wooden boxes glass test tubes ziploc bags etc .
1676	1	place a simple of one material into one container and label it . repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container .
1677	1	determine the mass of four different samples marble limestone wood plastic . they all have starting mass and end mass and the difference . the wood has the most mass but marble has the most difference in mass .
1678	1	in order to repeat the experiment you would need to know what you are testing for . they never say the reason for the experiment you need to know how much vinegar they used because that should be the same for each container . also in their procedure they dont tell what the samples aren t . if you only had the procedure and not the graph you wouldnt be able to replicate is because you dont know what they were testing in the vinegar .
1679	1	to replicate this experiment you would need four new samples . you would also need more vinegar and new containers to do the experiment in .
1680	1	after reading the procedure there is a lot more information that they need in order to replicate this experiment . they should say how much vinegar to put into the container and which container to put it in . they should be more specific when stating how things should be measured by saying measure mass on a triple beam balance etc .
1681	1	after reading the group s procedures i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar in each container . this important because it could affect how much of the sample is dissolved . i would also need to know were to store the containers in a cold or hot room with light or dark . also i would need to know the formula for finding the difference in case i didn t know . it is a common error to subtract the wrong masses . finally i would need to know how long to rinse each sample and whether to dry the samples under light or not . this would affect its weight .
1682	1	after reading the groups procedure i would need to know the names of the three samples being tested in the experiment . the amount of the sample being poured into the containers would also be necessary as well as the amount of distilled water being used to rinse each sample . another important factor would be to know the location of samples were placed in to sit and dry for minutes . how the students recorded the mass would also be needed to replicate the experiment .
1683	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to determine the mass and then label each of the four containers . i would also need to put the same amount of vinegar in each container . the last additional changes i would do is to clean up gather my materials first and then determine which material is right for solving my problem .
1684	1	what the hypothesis is what they are trying to prove . how much vinegar is needed and added to each sample . what can be used as a constant
1685	1	after reading the groups procedure the additional information i conclude that they need for me to replicate the experiment is where do you put the samples when you replace them from the containers and how to determine the mass .
1686	1	to replicate the group s experiment the procedure would have to state how much vinegar was poured into the containers . also they should specify what kinds of containers they were using as this could affect the results . in the procedure they also failed to tell what samples were used in the experiment a key variable to it s success .
1687	1	some information that i would need to replicate the experiment are a list of the materials id need to know how to determine the mass because those things are not stated in the procedure .
1688	1	to replicate this experiment the person would need to state how much vinegar to use how they re going to determine the mass of the end and how long to rinse of the samples with water .
1689	1	information that would be required to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar to be poured in each container the size or amount of each sample of material and where to store the sample when they are drying from the vinegar .
1690	1	the student should have stated in the hypothesis that they predicted and correct or not . also they should have added what could ve went wrong in the experiment and what should they have worked on to make better .
1691	1	in the procedure there is not enough information for someone to replicate this experiment . the procedure should include naming rinse four samples that need to be determined and how much vinegar needs to be poured in the containers . the students should also state what they will be measuring when determining the mass . these three things could improve the procedure of the experiment .
1692	1	one piece of information that i would add is how much vinegar to use in each container . the nd piece i would add is how big the container should be . a third piece of information that i would add to this experiment is to tell the person to mark all the information down into a nice organized table .
1693	1	for me to be able to replicate this experiment i would just have to follow the procedure over again . for example i would have to determine the mass of all four samples . next i would pour the vinegar in each of four separate containers and act .
1694	1	additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is you would need to know the data collected from before . another thing you would need is to know the collected information on last and final thing you would need to know is what happened after the next before having it out for minutes . what was in the when you pilled it out .
1695	1	in this experiment i would also include how it looked after hours why the mass went down and why you would put the samples to sit and dry for minutes .
1696	1	you would need a list of things to get supplies . those would include such things as a scale cups the samples vinegar and distilled water . another thing needed was the names of the samples themselves in the question . and there is no reason or problem stated .
1697	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the samples you re using are . in step it says to determine the mass of four different samples . also in step it tells you to place each sample in a different container . however you are never told what the samples are that you are using .
1698	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers . i would need to know this because if i just poured vinegar into four cups the amounts would be different and it could change the results of my experiment .
1699	1	any additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar to use so there are same amount in each container how much water to rinse with because to little might not wash off all the vinegar and to much might wash off some of the materials and affect the final mass also students may need to know what unit to measure the materials in . so they can get almost exactly what the other group got .
1700	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to find out what kind of containers i need . i would also need to know what to put the samples on to sit and dry . finally i would need to find out what the students used to obtain the mass of the samples .
1701	1	the procedure is very unclear . in order to replicate this experiment the procedure must be more specific for example instructions must be made about how much vinegar must you pour into the containers what kind of containers should be used specify what the four samples are in the procedure .
1702	1	in order to replicate the experiment you need to add to the procedure . first you d need to know what four samples to use how much of the sample to use how much vinegar to add to the sample decide what container to put the sample in and how much distilled water is used to rinse the sample .
1703	1	to be able to separate this experiment their needs to be more information in the procedure . the students should be specified for amount of vinegar added to the samples . the students should ve added that the experiment should be repeated to be sure the results were correct . the last thing that was missing from the procedure is a list of the four samples being used .
1704	1	in order to replicate this experiment they must supply more specific information for example they should list the four different sample names . second they should give the size of the container . last they must specify how much vinegar and the possible strength of that vinegar .
1705	1	after reading the groups procedure information that needs to be included is tell what they are taking samples of . another thing they should include to how much vinegar they are mixing with each sample . the final thing they should include is about how much of each sample to use . those would be needed to replicate the experiment .
1706	1	well the procedure does not state what the four samples are and you need to know that in order to do anything . you also need to know how much vinegar should be used . and you would need to know whether the samples are placed into the same containers as the ones with vinegar .
1707	1	you would need to know how much vinegar you need to put into each container . you need to have a control sample . after washing the sample do you put it back into the container
1708	1	give the amount of each sample needed for the experiment have the amount of vinegar needed to the experiment . give the amount of freely to rinse and how long do varies and should the all same time and what temperature was the water .
1709	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the control was . if there even was one to begin with . the measurements for the vinegar and amount of each material placed in the vinegar are also left out . the names of the materials should also be mentioned in the procedure .
1710	1	after reading the group s procedure the additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be the different samples used . how much vinegar is going to be poured into each of the containers and what should the containers be labeled .
1711	1	in order for me to replicate the experiment i would need o know how much vinegar to pour in each cup and how much f one substance . without doing that it can effect each substance differently .
1712	1	the procedure should explain what the samples are . the procedure should say to calculate the difference in mass of each substance . the procedure should explain how much vinegar to use .
1713	1	some additional information would of bee what four examples should we what or what adding vinegar to the samples as getting to do .
1714	1	in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know what materials the samples are made of . step number three would need to be revised to say that each sample has it s own cup of vinegar . also an amount of vinegar was not determined . a constant starting mass should have been used between the four materials because the vinegar may have eroded more of one material due to a larger amount of surface area .
1715	1	some additional information that you would need to replicate this experiment would be things like the mass of each of the samples before they were put in the vinegar . the temperature of the vinegar when it was put in the cup with the samples the size of the containers that the sample and solution were in and the amount of vinegar that they put in the cups and also weather they did multiple trails or not .
1716	1	you would need the bishop ping and you would need to know were they got the number from .
1717	1	how much vinegar do you put into the containers . take out materials . determine the mass with a triple beam balance .
1718	1	to replicate this experiment i need to know the materials and how to find the mass because one cannot assume that another person knows what they are doing .
1719	1	at least include three piece of information in order to replicate the experiment . the procedure are determine the mass of four different samples . pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers place a sample of one material into one container and label . repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container after hours remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water . determine the mass of each sample .
1720	1	in the procedure it should state how to determine the mass of each material . also it should state the amount of vinegar poured into the container .
1721	1	three pieces of information needed to replicate the experiment are amount of vinegar poured into the containers . size of samples marble limestone wood plastic and how much distilled water is used to rinse the samples .
1722	1	to replicate this experiment it would be important to know how much vinegar should be poured into the four containers in step . this is unclear therefore the amount of vinegar should be specified . next the group should specify how much a single sample is . the samples should be constant therefore results are comparable . the group should decide on a certain mass sample to use for the four materials . lastly to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with . right now this information is vague .
1723	1	in order to replicate this experiment i believe that the group needs to include more information on the sample . they need to say where the samples are being stored during the hours and at what temperature . based on this given information the could be located outdoors or indoors where the temp would effect the rock sample . also they must include the amount of vinegar used in the container . they simply tell us to pour vinegar but never include an amount .
1724	1	to determine the mass put what form of weight system your weighing it on grams pounds etc . . . when pouring the vinegar put what you ll be measuring water ml liters etc be none descriptive when labeling samples .
1725	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to put in . you would need to know what the group is testing . you would also need to know what the group is testing for what is their statement
1726	1	some additional information that i would need is i was to replicate this experiment is what samples to get . they would need to say we got all four samples then heated them . another piece of information that i may need is to find out the difference in mass from before and after the experiment . and last is to have a step that says to release the scale so that the mass can be removed .
1727	1	in order to replicate this experiment the procedure would need to include the amount of vinegar used in each cup . we would also need to know what the samples are while the data table identifies them it is not clear from the procedure what we are testing . also we would need to know exactly what it is were testing . the procedure should include something about recording the starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass .
1728	1	in order to replicate the experiment you must have to mention the four types of samples . list the mass and after you have you see the difference in mass and double with the information of the results of the mass .
1729	1	the additional information i would need in other to replicate the experiment is to named the sample that i would have used in the experiment .
1730	1	i would add how much vinegar is being added to the four containers . i would also add more samples to the lab . and i would repeat the lab again to see if i get the same answers .
1731	1	the first thing i would have to know is . what are my samples going to be of i would also want to know how much vinegar i m suppose to pour in each container . i also would need to know what type of container i m to store the samples in .
1732	1	. determine the mass of four different samples marble limestone wood and plastic p . pour ml of vinegar in each of four separate but identical beakers . p . place a sample of one material into one container and label . repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container place all of containers in the same place .
1733	1	you would also need beakers and test tube and a timer .
1734	1	you would need to know how much vinegar needed for each container also how big the containers are that you need to put the materials in to ensure that they fit . the placement of the containers is important because if they are left in the sun when they shouldn t be it could change the results . how much distilled water one needs to put into each container is important to know too .
1735	1	besides knowing the procedure in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know what the problem is that we are trying to solve . that way i could make sure i am coming up with the right information to answer the problem . another piece of information i would have to know is if there is a control group . this is because if there was one i could compare my data from the different samples to the control group . also i would have to know what the control variables are because if all of the variables that need to be controlled are not that my information would not be as valid as it could be .
1736	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add in each container and how big each containers . it also doesn t let you know how big each sample should be or what type of material . plus it should remind people to wear goggles and clean up their area .
1737	1	the additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar that was pored into each container the temperature of vinegar how long and miserable the samples should be rinsed number of trials type of container the sample should be placed in and what types of equipment should be used to determine the mass .
1738	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in the four containers .
1739	1	you wouldn t need any additional information . that past jar was correct and could be duplicated the way it is presented in the procedure .
1740	1	what kind of vinegar how much vinegar what kind of surrounding do you dry the samples .
1741	1	after reading this group procedure i would need to know how many units of vinegar should be added to each cup which samples to test not what the starting mass for each sample should be these three factors were left out and these factors are vital to the experiment .
1742	1	in order to replicate the experiment the students should add more procedures . they would double the hours to see what would happen . repeat the experiment and not rinse the samples with distilled water . and don t dry the samples .
1743	1	to replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar was used for the samples to sit in . we would also need to know what the samples were that we were testing in order for the experiment to work . and we would also need to know that we should be recording all of the data that we were collecting . we would also need to know that we should subtract the differences in masses to be able to compare the results .
1744	1	the additional information you will need is at the end say to record what you have found out . also i would say has with distilled water to use to use plan s ruin anything .
1745	1	. the amount of materials that you need . p . how much vinegar do you pour .
1746	1	the additional information needed would be if there was a constant variable . if there was a certain temperature that the samples sat in and how they got the difference in mass .
1747	1	i think that i would need the timing because i guess they have to take the time and i also think that i need the measure of the four mass samples . and how big were the materials .
1748	1	i would need to know what four different samples to use what kind of containers to put them in and i would also need to know how to find the mass of each of the samples after they dried . without this information i could not replicate this lab .
1749	1	the procedure needs to state what samples to use instead of asking the reader refer to the data . for exact data . the procedure must also state how much vinegar to use . also step three doesn t state whether or not to put the samples in the water but separate containers as the vinegar .
1750	1	need to know how much weight of the sample to start with how much acid rain should be put in the test tubes .
1751	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . this would allow the experiment to work dignity . if one container had more vinegar than the other then the experiment would fail .
1752	1	when the procedure says pour vinegar in each container you don t know how much vinegar to put in . also when it says place a sample of one material i don t know how much that is to put in the container . it also doesn t say how big the container has to be .
1753	1	the i . v . d . v . control variables and constant variables must be included in the procedure .
1754	1	in order to make this experiment replicate you would need to be more specific . for step number three it should clarify which sample and how much of it to place in the container . they should add a step between three and four saying where to place . he samples for hours for the last step they should explain how to determine the mass by using a triple beam balance .
1755	1	one thing that would be helpful to be able to replicate this experiment would be to know how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how big the containers are . they should have also told us what the materials were that they were using and how much of it to use . another thing that should have been included was how they are going to determine the mass of everything .
1756	1	. you would need to know the four types of samples in this experiment . p . you need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four containers . p . you need to know what temperatures to have the samples in room warm cold .
1757	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar placed in each container . you would also need to know the temperature at which the containers were stored . in addition you would need to know what materials the samples were .
1758	1	in order to replicate the experiment the additional information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers . i would need to know how long i should rinse the samples with distilled water . i would also need to know how this group determined the mass of each samples in order to replicate the experiment .
1759	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was used to see if that played a major factor on the difference in mass . also you need to know how much distilled water is used to rinse off each sample because the water may wear away the sample . even more lastly you need to know what your measuring the mass with .
1760	1	in order to replicate the experiment the additional information you would need is what the samples were how much vinegar was put into the containers and also the temperature of what they are going to put the containers because whether vinegar may us more acidic .
1761	1	after reading this procedure i have figured out that you would need to know the type of the containers used weather or not they were test tubes beakers etc . also you would need to know how much of each sample you would need in oz kg g etc . finally you would need to know how much vinegar to use in l ml etc .
1762	1	additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the data table that was recorded starting the into on each sample . information such as the samples starting to ending mass and difference is very important to understand because it is needed to understand the results of the experiment .
1763	1	first i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers second i would need to know what the size of each sample needs to be . then i have to know how much acidity is in the water .
1764	1	you would not need any other information to replicate the experiment they tell you how long to put the samples in the vinegar how to rinse them how big to let them sit . but one thing is how much vinegar did they use in each container .
1765	1	the additional information that i would add is how much vinegar in each container i would also add a purpose of the experiment . after massing the samples on step determine the sample difference in before and after weight .
1766	1	after reading the groups procedure some information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to measure out how much liquid vinegar they used for each sample and then measure it again after they take the sentiment are to measure it .
1767	1	well after reading the groups procedure i realized that the additional information they need to give you is how much vinegar to pour into the four separate but identical containers . the group does not show that the samples sat for hours then they removed the samples and rinsed each sample with distilled water . also how do i know like where i am supposed to dry them in a windowsill in the cup in a microwave or just to let it sit there till it drys .
1768	1	the three most important pieces of info that would need to replicate this experiment is to determine the mass of the different samples pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers and after hours resume the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water .
1769	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was used what she was the container that held the vinegar and what temperature the containers where kept at during the hours .
1770	1	additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment are what are the different samples that i would be testing what size container would i need and how much vinegar do i use .
1771	1	in step one the procedure needs to explain what four materials are being tested . it is not specific enough by just saying four different sample . in step the procedure should state how much vinegar needs to be added to each container . the reader has no way of knowing this information . p the procedure says that the containers should each be labeled but it does not explain how they should be labeled or what they should say . in order to be able to replicate this experiment that must be clarified .
1772	1	some of the things that you would need enables to repeat this experiment is tell you what samples they are using . all they say is get the mass of four different samples don t state what they are . also how much vinegar is being added to the containers . they did not say what amount of vinegar they put in . the last thing is that
1773	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the samples mentioned in step are . this way there would be no confusion as to what materials you are working with . also you would need to know what kind of containers the samples are kept in . lastly in order to properly replicate the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
1774	1	i would need to know how the samples look in the procedure . i feel like this because i already know starting ending and difference in all mass . to do the difference i would have to knee how it was doing threw the procedures .
1775	1	after reading this groups procedure i decided that it would need more information in order for me to accurately replicate in one thing . i thought it would need be a given amount of vinegar to be put in each cue like ml for example . i also thought that the names of the samples marble limestone wood and plastic should be given for without them i would not know i was testing . lastly i would include a final step thus told the sender to determine the difference between the starting and finding mass so that the reader knows where to go next .
1776	1	one would need to know how much vinegar went into each container . one would also need to know how the samples were and their masses .
1777	1	first the group should tell how much of the vinegar to use also they should say how much vinegar the experiment needs to be done . finally they should tell you what in the materials being weighted on .
1778	1	there are three pieces of information you might need to replicate this experiment . the first is how much vinegar to use in each container . a second would be the type of conditions the container was placed in over night because things like light might cause a faster or more effective reaction on the samples . third you would need to know in what form the samples are . the marble or limestone could be in small rock form as oppose to all solid blocks which may cause the reaction to have a different outcome .
1779	1	this group should for scientific verification repeat i the experiment at least twice . they should also specify the amount of vinegar in each container . the group should have had a control to contrast their findings .
1780	1	you would need to know how much vinegar you would put in each container . and also you d have to make sure that you put equal amounts into each container or else you would find an number of errors in the experiment .
1781	1	i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers . also i would need to know how much distilled water i would need to rinse each sample and for how long .
1782	1	determine the mass of four different samples . place a sample of one material into one container and label . repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container . determine the mass of each sample . allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes .
1783	1	in order to repeat this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each of the four samples . this would be essential for us to repeat the experiment step by step . it would also be helpful to determine how much of each sample to put in each container . and finally in order to repeat this experiment we would also have to do another trial and probably include a control variable to repeat this experiment exactly like the group of students .
1784	1	to replicate the experiment by just reading the procedure i would need to know how much vinegar was poured onto the samples and affects the mass also what type size the container was because that would affect the concentration of the vinegar and also what material the sample were at the type of environment temperature brightness they were left in for the hour period because that would also affect the end result .
1785	1	in order to replicate this experiment additional information should be added . for example the procedure should explain what type of samples to use include the number of tools that are needed and how much of an object or sample you need . after adding these procedures a person would be able to repeat this experiment .
1786	1	some information needed to replicate this procedure would be the temperature that this experiment . another piece of information would be a graph . and lastly would be a better explanation .
1787	1	you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each of four separate containers . did you remove the samples from the containers and rinse the samples with distilled water also how long did you let the samples sit and dry
1788	1	in order to replicate the experiment what will be needed is the depended independent and the control which are vinegar the container and the timing to each sample .
1789	1	to replicate this procedure information such as how much vinegar to pour into the containers as instructed in step what materials were used in step or how much of the material was used also in would be crucial .
1790	1	what temperature environment should the containers be placed it . cold hot room temp p after hours do you need gloves and or goggles to work with this samples p where could find marbles and limestone
1791	1	in order to replicate this experiment i need to know specifically what samples they are talking about what type of control to use in this experiment and how much vinegar to pour in each container . i would also be useful to know if when storing the sample for hours if they should be in a certain temperature room temp high temp or low temp . etc .
1792	1	the students should have included . how they determined the mass of the four samples in steps or . they also needed to include how much vinegar they poured in the containers as well as how much water they used to rinse the samples or how long they rinsed them .
1793	1	a group os student did a science project called acid pain had to determine four different samples . the put the four different samples which is marble limestone wood and plastic in four different cups filler with vinegar and after hours rinse the examples and dry them for minutes and see what is the mass after every sample loss mass expect for wood . i had the same mass after it was measured .
1794	1	i think the group should mention how much vinegar they are using for measurements . and they should include to record data procedure should be written more clearly it would be hard to do this lab looking at this procedure they gave us .
1795	1	in order to replicate this experiment one would need much more information . firstly step says to pour vinegar into four containers . in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each . i would also need to know how much of the four different samples marble limestone wood and plastic to use . also in step it says to let the samples sit and dry for minutes . i would need to know if i should let them dry at room temp in a cold location in a sunny spot etc .
1796	1	after reading the groups procedure some prices of information you would need to replicate the experiment is the samples like marble limestone and wood .
1797	1	i think you will need a bottle of vinegar a container labels temper paper a mantle a cement stone wood and a plastic . you will need . .
1798	1	in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into the samples . you will also need to know what are the four samples . you will also need to know contents controls . the procedure needs to be made clear .
1799	1	you would need to know the containers size and what you measure the samples with
1800	1	step one pour a vinegar in four identical containers . p step two place a material in each container and label it . p step three after hours remove the material and rinse it out with water . p step four allow the samples to dry for minutes and determine the mass .
1801	1	in the procedure they did not tell the sample s that they was doing to be testing . also didn t tell us what mass was when they started and when they was finish what was the mass . last they didn t tell us that they need to find the difference in mass .
1802	1	in order to correct the errors in this experiment some few things need to be changed . firstly the procedure never mentions recording your data this needs to be part of the procedure . secondly the procedure states determine the mass . it is not explained how to do so and what to use . thirdly the procedure never tells what samples are or what to label them as in the experiment . this is extremely important because the people doing the experiment need to know what they are working with .
1803	1	their are three things that i would need to know to repeat the procedure . the first thing is in their procedure they do not mention the four samples . another thing is the procedure does not state the ph of the vinegar . also they do not repeat the process for greater validity . another thing is it serves ways to setup the content in the procedure .
1804	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know first what were the samples when they just said sample if i don t know theyre of the sample then how was i supposed to test for anything i also would need to know what type of containers they were taller about her they using for small graduated cylinder or were or were they using a gallon unit . finally i would need to know they amounts i need the amounts of the samples the vinegar and the distilled water .
1805	1	additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is what materials i would need for this experiment the amount i m support to pour in the containers and what are the samples .
1806	1	how much vinegar they are pouring in to each sample .
1807	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need the following information . first i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container . second i would need to find out the exact size of of four identical containers . finally i would need to know the temperature at which the four materials sat for hours because the temperatures of the solution room could affect the results .
1808	1	i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container how to weigh the mass of the deeds how big of the object do i need .
1809	1	in order to replicate this experiment i ll need more information . if i wanted to find the change in mass of the four samples i would ve had each sample weigh the same at the beginning of the experiment . also to make this lab more correct all of the samples should have the same amount of vinegar in them . lastly in order to make the lab more correct i would put the exact steps in the procedure . instead of saying repeat it d be better and easier if it said exactly what to do .
1810	1	in order to repeat his group s procedure you must have the same amour of mass of each cup . place the same material into the same one it had the mass amount . then proceed with the same thing that you did with the last one . sit for hours then rinse with distilled water .
1811	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know the purpose . knowing the purpose of the experiment allows the person to know what to look for or to expect . you would also need to know what type of containers to do the experiment in so the experiment doesn t go wrong . you would need to know where to remove the samples into after taken out of their containers . you would also need to know what to do with the containers afterwards .
1812	1	in order to replicate this experiment you need to explain why the samples loss mass what cause it to loss its host or why did it stay the same . yo also need to tell us what you saw show us what happened when the samples were losing its mass . maybe you need to try chemicals on the samples beside vinegar .
1813	1	the group would need to state how much vinegar was in each container . they would need to state how long to rinse each container with distilled water . they would need to identify what the four samples are in the procedure and to say to record the data .
1814	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to put in . a so the strength of vinegar if there is a difference . where should the container so far the of have i . e in a every regardless room temperature
1815	1	you would need p conclusion about how you did everything . p results of how everything came out as you wanted . p information about the procedures .
1816	1	i think that you should start each sample with the same amount of mass so that your result will be more accurate . also instead of writing the differences they should have recorded the final results to make it less confusing .
1817	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how to determine the mass . just stating determine the mass does not tell me how to . i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the containers to make the data accurate and constant . i would need to know where to dry the samples would they need to be in the sun shade etc .
1818	1	in order to replicate the experiment we would need amount of vinegar used size of container used and how much distilled water was used for rinsing .
1819	1	additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be a more specific description of mass and how much mass you are using what kind of containers need to be used and what size .
1820	1	they should have done more tests . they also should have wrote what the experiment was about .
1821	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar that is to be poured into each container . you would also need to know the amount of distilled water the container are to be rinsed with and what qualities a sample to be the most efficient .
1822	1	i would need to know what sample was put in each container . also how much vinegar was poured into each container .
1823	1	you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container as well as the size and shape of each container . you would also want to know the type of vinegar used all three of the factors are important to insure consistency and increase validity .
1824	1	to be able to replicate this problem you would have to know how much vinegar is going into each container . also why they are performing the experiment what the problem is what are the different samples .
1825	1	there are several pieces of information missing from this procedure . first it is important to know in the procedure that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic . this information is not given until the data table also the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be poured into the containers . finally it is necessary to know how much of each sample material should be added to the containers with vinegar . with this information replicating the experiment would be much easier .
1826	1	the additional information is how are we suppose to measure the mass of the object they need a indecent variable and i need to then the control .
1827	1	the additional information needed is p name the specific samples used in the procedure p say how much vinegar one needs to pour into containers p should the samples sit in light dark areas or covered
1828	1	some information that you would need is the amount of vinegar you should pour into these operate containers . second of all we should also know how long we rinse the samples for . finally we need the previous results to compare data .
1829	1	additional information needs to be added to this procedure they need to put gather materials for step one . they need to tell exactly what samples rocks . they need to add the amount of vinegar they are going to pour in . they need to make the last sentence in step three a separate step . this procedure was not carefully organized .
1830	1	what the group forgot to do was tell the amount of vinegar to pour in each container . the group also forgot to include whether or not if they need to cover each container . they forgot to tell what metric unit to measure the materials with which was grams .
1831	1	in order to replicate this acid rain experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use since it should remain a constant . also how big each sample is results will not be accurate if the samples are not similar in size . also all samples should be kept at the same temperature in the same area so they are not affected differently .
1832	1	the group could have told how much vinegar the actual size of the container they used and the size if all the samples . for example how large was the piece of wood would size make a difference in the ending mass and the calculation of the difference in mass .
1833	1	in this table it s says that first when starting mass that time marble was . then it s decrease it would . . so it s decrease . . in limestone the mass is decrees too . first starting mass is . and then ending mass is . . it s difference between . . in wood no change . in starting mass it was . and ending mass it would . too . so it s in no change . in plastic starting mass is . and ending mass is . . it is decreases . it s in difference between . . i think wood is not heavy then other that s why it s in no change . then limestone it s in big change to other because it s heavy them other .
1834	1	in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know what was in each of the four samples . also one must know how much vinegar to pour into each sample . you would also have to know which sample of material was placed in which container .
1835	1	you would need to include what the samples are of . you would need to include where to record data . finally you would also need to know if the mass of each sample should be the same . without those bits of information it would be difficult to replicate the experiment .
1836	1	in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need to see a few more pieces of information in their procedure . firstly i would need to know what types of samples to use . i can see what samples the group used by looking at their data table but i would want to know if i had to use the same ones . also i would have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because my results could change if i use a different amount of vinegar than the group did . depending on the amount of vinegar i use the third thing i would need to know is how big the samples should be . if it is important for the vinegar to cover the sample the procedure should tell me that so i don t make the sample too big .
1837	1	to replicate the experiment additional information would include new loco wait before trying the experiment again . it should are state how much of the samples are being put into the container and how long the samples should be rinsed for .
1838	1	additional information that would need are to list what are the different samples being used
1839	1	in order to replicate this procedure i would need to know what the materials were the size of the material and how much vinegar was in each container .
1840	1	this isn t a clear statement . use to this experiment the problem would explain why the students were conducting this experiment in the first place .
1841	1	the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be knowing what the solutions are such as marble limestone wood and plastic . you need to be more specific so the reader can completely do the experiment by themselves without asking questions .
1842	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know what safety precautions i should be taking the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container and where the samples should be kept during the hours they are in the container .
1843	1	the person conducting the experiment would have to know what the samples were the procedure didn t include that knowledge . another piece of information that would be needed to repeat the experiment would be how much vinegar is used for each sample and is the amount kept constant . the last piece of information that is needed is what safety equipment should be used safety procedures are often included in the experiment s procedure .
1844	1	there is some additional information needed to replicate the this experiment . for example the procedure does not say how much vinegar to use . it also just says samples and doesn t specify what the samples are of . the procedure also does not tell us what type of containers to use or say to record your data .
1845	1	if i were to rewrite the procedure i would include what the samples were . also i would include how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers .
1846	1	in order to replicate the group s experiment one must know the amount of vinegar used on each of the samples . also what type and the amount of sample is needed . in addition knowing the purpose of the lab would be highly beneficial so that one knows what to test for . it s imperative to add the amount of samples and the amount of vinegar in order to perform the experiment in all exactness . otherwise one might receive not only different but in accurate data .
1847	1	the students need to be more specific . they need to state how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups . second they never said what unit or never said when to record the data . lastly they needed to state how much distilled water .
1848	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the cups . you would also need to know how long to rise the sample with distilled water .
1849	1	additional information that would be needed is the initial amount of vinegar then the amount of vinegar after the hours and then the difference in the volume . if i had those three pieces of info i would be able to replicate the experiment and possibly compare answers .
1850	1	additional information needed to replicate
1851	1	to follow this groups procedure i would have to be more detailed like instead of saying samples all the way through the procedure it would have been better if they the four things that they were testing in it would be less confusion . in step two it would have been much better they just made it less complicated and sad place the marble limestone wood and plants samples into their own separate identical containers and label them . it would have been good to explain why they were told to find the mass of their samples .
1852	1	the information you would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the four different samples the starting ending and difference in mass you would need the four samples marble limestone wood plastic because that s what the experiment is on . you would need the starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass because that s how your doing the experiment .
1853	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would also want to test all these four samples in water as a control in the same exact procedure . furthermore it is also important to detest this experiment under a constant like room temperature to make sure it is not a variable in the results . lastly to replicate this experiment you would need to know the chemicals in acid rain and chemical composition of vinegar to see if they corporate and that this experiment is a good representation of what happens i acid rain .
1854	1	after reading the groups procedure i would need to know what samples were used . if i did not use the same samples my experiment could come out differently . i would also need to know what unit to weigh the mass in . if i weighed it differently we could get different results . i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container that could affect the outcome of my experiment .
1855	1	to replicate the experiment one would need to know what the samples were . without this information it would be impossible to do the experiment . one would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to each container this could effect the outcome of the experiment . in addition one would need to know the temperature of the vinegar which could also effect the outcome of the experiment .
1856	1	additional information that you might need in order to replicate the experiment is to conduct a hypothesis you will need to get organized and gather all information to be able to perform a conclusion in the end with the information .
1857	1	i would need to know which type of materials to use for the samples . p i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each containers . p i would need to know the approximate size of the samples .
1858	1	one additional information needed would be how to determine the mass of each sample . how much vinegar would be put in to each of the containers . how big would the containers need to be .
1859	1	you would need to say what different sample you had in the experiment . where would you put them over night . how big would the containers be for the samples .
1860	1	additional data that i would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that was added into the container because if one sample measured more or less than another the data may also bear altered . i would also need to know the size or the container used and what type of units they were measured with . lastly to be able to replicate this experiment . one would also need to know the temperature for every it s materials . such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit and dry on a substance .
1861	1	there is not enough information to be able to replicate the experiment . firstly they should state the samples you need to use in step one . there should also be a control for you to compare it to . the final error is that step is too vague . it says to remove the samples but not how to for example with tongs or wearing plastic gloves .
1862	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the size of each of the samples . also i would need to know the amount of vinegar being used . last i would need to know the size of the containers being used and how long to rinse the samples of rock for .
1863	1	do the experiment again but with a different solution . p let the samples sit for hours . p instead of sit and dry . dry the sample with a paper towel or cloth .
1864	1	the group did not include the temperature that they left the remaining samples . they also did not include the amount of vinegar that we should pour in the four separate containers . also they should of do the experiment more than once to make sure the answers they come out with were alright .
1865	1	the group s procedure needs to be more specific . they need amounts in the procedure . they do not tell you how much vinegar is to be poured . also what is needed to determine the mass of the samples . also the samples how much of the sample we need .
1866	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know the control of the experiment what amount of vinegar is poured on sample what is being tested including independent and dependent parade .
1867	1	in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i need to pour into each container if i would need to stable the mass of the samples with the vinegar still on it and also luck at why am even performing this experiment .
1868	1	the lab needs to include what samples are being added to the vinegar . next time the lab should say that you should place a sample of marble limestone wood and plastic to each vinegar sample .
1869	1	to repeat this experiment they would need a balance to measure the mass of each building material . you would also need a graduated cylinder to measure out the vinegar out . in the experiment it does say the amount of vinegar used .
1870	1	additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment would be what types of containers what type of materials and lastly how much vinegar should be poured in to each container because it doesn t state these items in their procedure .
1871	1	you would also need to .
1872	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they put in the containers . you would also have to know how to dry the samples . then you would have to know how to dry the samples .
1873	1	in order to replicate the experiment in the procedure it should say to write down or mark a chart saying the starting mass and ending mass and start the experiment . you need to write down this information because it helps to find out the mass of the different samples .
1874	1	in order to replicate the procedure i would need to know what volume of vinegar to use . i would also need to know what sized containers or beaker to use . the procedure should also explain what equipment to use when removing the samples from the container such as tongs . lastly within the procedure it should state what samples will be used .
1875	1	the procedure should look like this determine the mass of different samples marble limestone water and plastic . pour ml how much of vinegar in each separate but identical containers . place a sample of one material into one container label . repeat w remaining samples placing a single sample into a single center . after hours remove the samples from the containers rinse with distilled water for minutes . allow the samples to sit dry for minutes at room temperature . determine the mass of each sample by subtracting the start mass in grams from ending mass in grams .
1876	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each cup so each sample would be sitting in the same amount of vinegar . i would need to know how long to rinse the sample for so they are rinsed an equal amount of time . also i need to know if each sample is supposed to way the same or be the same size .
1877	1	in the procedure it didn t tell what the sample s were . step said to pour vinegar in four identical containers but it didn t tell how much to pour . we don t measure them we are going to do the experiment wrong . step could of said record the starting mass of each of the four samples marble limestone wood and plastic .
1878	1	after reading the group s procedure i believe that i would need the following information in order to replicate the experiment . i would need the different types of materials listed in the procedure .
1879	1	to do the experiment you would have to know the starting masses how much vinegar must be added to each container and what the sample materials are
1880	1	in order to replicate the group s procedure you would need to know p how much vinegar should be pour each cup p what type of container should be used p if the container should be left in the light or dark overnight or it avoid be covered .
1881	1	the pour into the take the vinegar in each containers . p who is the problem hypothesis p how you can do this experiment p a table who explain the experiment p use more types of masses like glass paper etc .
1882	1	one other thing you would need to know is the amount of vinegar placed in each container so all samples have the same amount . another thing needed to be known is where are the containers should be placed for hours because the amount of sunlight might effect the experiment . other than than this experiment is replicate .
1883	1	additional information is to include the sample names to label them . how much vinegar to use in the containers so the outcome is fair for all samples and also point out which is the independent variable and when is the dependent variable and which is the dependent variable to understand the lab better .
1884	1	you would need to tell how much vinegar was add to each sample at the start .
1885	1	the procedure needs a control for each sample material . this would be done by placing each sample into more containers with no vinegar . to use . the procedure needs to say the amount of vinegar to put into each container . the procedure should also say specifically what four samples to use .
1886	1	the group should have provided a control so that i could compare my results in it . they also should have been more clear about exactly how much vinegar i should put into each container . each container should have the same amount but they didn t state what that was . the group should have also been more specific about the size of the samples being experimented on . i m not sure if they all are the same or different .
1887	1	it would be best of they specify what they are sampling in in the procedure . it should say determine the mass of four different samples of material . in step number it says pour in vinegar but not how much . they should lied is at something like ml . for the graph it would be better if there was a column where it listed the percentages post so that the reader can understand which material was effected the mass .
1888	1	after reading the groups procedure one would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container .
1889	1	. amount of vinegar would be needed . p . purpose of the experiment would be needed . p . hypothesis would be needed .
1890	1	in order to replicate the experiment we need to know how much of the vinegar to poor in each container we would also need to know units of measurement we are using to determine the mass and what the samples are .
1891	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . you would need to get an average for the results . lastly you would need to have samples with the same mass at the start .
1892	1	some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment are the names of the different types of material so i knew i am testing . the amount of vinegar poured into each container needed to be stated on the results will come out accurate . another part of information that should have been included was a control of just water for each sample so there is something to compare the other results to .
1893	1	we would need to have a continue . also an independent variable and a dependent variable .
1894	1	in order for me to repeat the experiment i would need to know a little bit more information such as how much of each substance to use how much vinegar to use and what the temperature should be when letting the samples out in containers . this person has to be a lot more specific in his procedure very hard to follow
1895	1	they would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup what sample material would be determine the temp that the samples should dry at .
1896	1	the additional information you would and to replicate this experiment is you would need a lot of materials you would need to see the student observations and you would need to see the conclusion . basically a written lab report would be the best tool in recreating this experiments .
1897	1	in order for me to replicate this experiment i need to know how much vinegar do i need to pour in the containers . i need to know what the sample of the minerals are and i also need to know how i m going to measure the mass .
1898	1	in order to replicate the experiment you will need to record the mass of different samples . you also need to pour the vinegar into the separate containers you use her to wait hours are you have to let the sample dry for a while then you determine the mass .
1899	1	some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would also be to have the same amount of vinegar in each of the sample cups to have an equal effect nd would be to have the same amount of the sample get the same starting mass for all so in the end you can use which sample was effected the most . finally you should subtract the starting mass from the end mass to get the difference to see which was affected most by the substance .
1900	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers you would also need to know what temperature the room they are left in should be overnight and how much distilled water to use when rinsing the samples .
1901	1	how much vinegar is in each container what type of wood what is the control
1902	1	additional information needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers . another piece of information that is missing is how much is a sample of each material . finally you would repeat the experiment a couple of times to see if your results change .
1903	1	i wan need to know what samples to use co i need a graph of some sat to record the starting and ending mass . what unit of mass do the samples need to be weighed in .
1904	1	to do replication of the experiment you would need measure how much vinegar are dropping . the other stones have already been used and cannot be used again . you also need to have a triple beam balance to be able to see how much each stone eventually weighed . finally you would need to test them what they need to each sample for a separate minutes unless they all get different in at the same time .
1905	1	in order to replicate the experiment i need wood plastic limestone marble and vinegar . also i would need water to rinse the samples off with after the hour soak .
1906	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to what the sample are that are using . i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four samples . i would also need to know what i must use to take out the sample . would i use my hands or tongs
1907	1	if i were to replicate this i would need to know how much vinegar they put in each cup do you put different amount in different cups also where should i put the cups to rest inside outside would that have different out comes
1908	1	this procedure lacks important details and is not in order . step one is too similar to step . need to specify what kind of different samples and how to determine the beginning mass . step two needs to include the specific amount of vinegar for each container . the procedure should include the size needed for the samples to get accurate results . step should state what to label the containers with which information . in step they should include how to calculate the mass for example subtract beginning mass from end mass . add record data results .
1909	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was put into the container and what type of coma were used to hold the samples i would also need to know what the purpose of this experiment is in other words what is the group of student is trying to prove
1910	1	. how much vinegar do you put into the different containers . . how large is the sample being used . p . the dependent or the dependant
1911	1	one piece of information that should be included is the amount of vinegar necessary in each cup . also how the material s mass is determined should be included . lastly how big the material is should be stated .
1912	1	in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need the temperature of the vinegar . the amount of vinegar poured into each container and the amount of samples needed how much needed .
1913	1	some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is steps because there important to make the table accept . you would also need to make other table to show you resist and other information .
1914	1	the group needs to provide how much vinegar is being poured into the containers . the amount of vinegar can change the experiment .
1915	1	how much vinegar how big should the containers be and how big should the samples be are all additional information you would need to recreate this experiment .
1916	1	in order to replicate the experiment the person may need a diagram of the experiment . the person needs the problem or statement to determine what they maybe testing for . also they need the list of materials they have to use in order to do the experiment .
1917	1	you will need to explain what is happening with the vinegar . what happen to the sample after it drys and what the experiment looks like
1918	1	they need to say how much vinegar to put in each container . the also need to say where to put the label on the material itself on the cup or on the table in front of the cup . lastly they need to say how to remove the materials from the containers do they use their fingers or tongs .
1919	1	to replicate the experiment the group would need to better state the problem . give an amount of vinegar to put in the containers and lastly use more then one trial .
1920	1	information that would be needed in the procedure would be the name of the sample material . also you ll need when and how to measure the mass of materials . this information is needed to replicate the experiment .
1921	1	how much vinegar what kind of scale .
1922	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour on the rocks the purpose of this experiment and a control variable .
1923	1	three pieces of information i would need to replicate the experiment are vinegar to pour into the containers . a scale to weight the mass and find the difference at the end of the experiment and distilled water to rinse each sample with .
1924	1	in this procedure they leave out some thing that makes it im possible to recreate quantity it says nothing about how much vinegar or rock sam pl quantity also using cleaner numbers would make ite aster to recreate and read .
1925	1	in order to replicate the experiment you need to have information . some example of things you would need to no is how much vinegar is being poured in each of the separate containers . another thing that you would need to no is the volume of each substance because the surface area will effect how much is eroded off . another thing where you let the samples sit for minutes because there might be difference in temperature effecting how much it drys .
1926	1	the additional information that needed to be included are what the samples are . the amount of vinegar poured into the containers in step also need to be known . another part that needs more information is how much of each sample needs to be placed in the container in step . another part of this experiment that needs more information is step what type of container should the samples be placed into .
1927	1	one piece of information i would need is what are the four different samples . another piece of information is how much vinegar i need to pour into each container . the third piece of information i would need is how much and how long should i rinse each sample with distilled water . another piece of information you could use is at what temperature conditions are the samples left to sit and dry in .
1928	1	in order to replicate this group s experiment you will need top know how much vinegar is being used how long you rinse each sample and conditions the samples are drying in .
1929	1	you would need to know what to take samples of . the procedure isn t specific in what materials are being weighed . you would also need to know any safety procedures to be taken while conducting this experiment . also the procedure does not give a specific place to leave the containers . additionally the procedure should tell the dimensions of the samples so that their volumes are all the same .
1930	1	the additional information you would need to know is the shape size and liquid .
1931	1	to sec ruefully replicate the procedure i or anybody else would need the following information . first a statement that will tell me what . i am doing the lava for . materials list will also be needed . last i would need a better procedure that is
1932	1	in order to better replicate this experiment the students must also tell us the amount of vinegar poured into each cup m s the amount of water used to rinse the materials in m s and the time given to rinsing how long may each container rinsed in water .
1933	1	in the procedure number i doesn t explain what four different samples to use . another thing the procedure could have said was to list what materials to use . after reading this procedure i would be able to replicate this experiment . not knowing how much vinegar to pour in might mass up this experiment .
1934	1	some additional information that hey could put in the data is how much vinegar they pot in the container and another thing that they could say is about the temperature of the room or the vinegar .
1935	1	the three additional information that can be added is the control of the experiment the students could ve done these with a warm temperature and one with cold . lastly they could have used regular water than distilled water .
1936	1	in order to replicate this experiment . you would need the names of the samples you must use the measurements for the vinegar and the measurements amounts for each sample .
1937	1	some additional information the group could add is how much vinegar your supposed to put in each container . in addition this group could also include the size of the container they re using . finally i think they should have been a little more specific with their steps .
1938	1	in order to replicate this experiment additional information you would need is what do you use to measure the mass tell it in your procedure . tell the reader how much vinegar to put in each of the containers in step . also tell the reader where do you place the containers after they have been rinsed do you place them in a cold area hot area or room temperature . this could mess up the experiment if you are not told this .
1939	1	identify what are the four rocks they are going to use and if its all different shapes . also tell if the containers are the same size or not
1940	1	i think that they need to show how many cups they have the amount of vinegar and how much of the materials that they are using for there experiment .
1941	1	the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the four different samples so i can test the same thing . the seconds to saw vinegar to pour into the containers all the samples have the same quality level . you say this is to say now long tonne earn sample so the vinegar can wash off .
1942	1	there is a lot of additional information one would need to repeat this experiment . first the students should include the different names for the four samples in order for proper replication . furthermore the students should include the amount of vinegar that should be poured into the containers . the size of the sample should also be indicated in the procedure . furthermore it would be best if the size of the container was provided in the procedure .
1943	1	acid rain . p will repeat some samples make data and check if the experiment is correct .
1944	1	in the procedure it is not included how they determined the mass of the samples or what the samples were step . also it is not stated in step how to determine the mass . the temperature of the distilled water is not defined at constant in step . the location or temperature of the place where the four substances in step are not defined nor the temperature of where they are drying in step .
1945	1	the additional information that i would need would be the materials . so that we would know what we need to do the experiment . we need a desk explanation as to why we are determining the mass of each sample .
1946	1	additional information that i would need in order to conduct this experiment is what different kinds of samples how much vinegar to pour into each cup and also what to label the cups if i dont have any of this my experiment won t be valid . i need to know the independent and dependent variable and whats has to be constant . another thing is what are we using to weigh the samples with .
1947	1	you would need to know what you are using what the samples are . you would need to know what you are mixing the vinegar with such as if the cup is empty or if there is water or something in there . and you would need to know when you start the experiment .
1948	1	in group s acid rain procedure the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the mass they started of in how long after to remove the samples from the container and the time to allow the samples to sit and dry .
1949	1	instead of vinegar they should put a different kind of liquid to test with . also instead of leaving it for hours leave it for to see if there would be a certain change in mass . also when samples are ready to sit and dry leave them there for instead of minutes .
1950	1	the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar temperature of the vinegar .
1951	1	i would say wood because the mass difference is . on the starting mass is . so is the end of the mass .
1952	1	this group gave some of the information but not all because they didn t say how much vinegar they put in the container . and the only did trail trail is what it needed to be and the calculation cannot be accra because how they going to leave it in over min and then come back the next day and give me say has the got their calculations for are not enough into .
1953	1	st you would need to know what is they were trying to figure not p nd you need to know what material they are going to use rd i would need to know what there conclusion is
1954	1	in order to replicate it would mean that you would be more detailed and tell if the object is a solid liquid or gas its state of form and if it can move or its movable and describe the item or what type of item it is
1955	1	. you would need to measure the starting mass . p . you would need to measure the ending mass . p . you would need to measure the difference between the starting and ending mass .
1956	1	the additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is you would need to know the name of the samples that you putting in the container . you would also have to label the sample when you remove them from there containers .
1957	1	the additional information i would need is how much vinegar i would have to put into each sample . also in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much of a sample i needed in order to accurately results . the group also needs a problem question because another scientist might want to know why someone wants to do this experiment and what the other scientist was trying to determine or prove . also i would need to know how many trials i would need to do .
1958	1	one thing you could change is the amount of vinegar the sample size and were you dry it because of the temp .
1959	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample was used how warm the vinegar is and how much vinegar to put .
1960	1	additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed the size of the cups and also a control to see just how effective this experiment is .
1961	1	to replicate the experiment in the procedure they need to be more suspific as to say what the four different samples are . they should also be more suspific on how they measure the mass . the third thing they should do is told which material they were using and then said reaped steps so that it is clearer and easier to understand .
1962	1	one piece of information would be how much vinegar to pour into the four containers . another piece of information would be how much of the sample materials to place into the containers so all four containers don t have an advantage or disadvantage because of unequal amounts . a last piece of info . would be what temperature to keep the containers in .
1963	1	you would need to know what samples you are using how to determine the mass of them and what containers you must use .
1964	1	i would need to know
1965	1	an additional piece of information you would need to replicate the experiment is the temperature of the environment the samples are in because they already have the starting mass ending mass and the time period .
1966	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar the group of students how poured into the containers . secondly what kind of containers did the students use . thirdly what expecting is in the sample itself .
1967	1	in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know what to weigh the objects that i am testing with . i also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and also the unit of measure that i am measuring the vinegar with .
1968	1	after reading the groups procedure i think i need to know p how much vinegar did they pour into each containers . p is every containers get same amount of vinegar . p is every samples sit and dry in same environment .
1969	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what amount of each sample to use where to to dry the samples and how big the containers should be .
1970	1	some additional information would be what samples are going into the cups also how much of each sample are in a cup and why are they doing this experiment .
1971	1	this is not a clear statement of the experiments . clear statement of the problem would include an expiation of why students were investigation and the fain .
1972	1	the mass is ending . and of the wood is . in who the two are difference at the mass and at wood because have different peso .
1973	1	in this procedure there are a couple pieces of information that should be included . they should tell you how much vinegar you use and if it is the same amount for each sample . also . it should tell you to record the data of starting mass they could tell you how long to rinse the sample and the names of the samples could be included in the procedure . finally at the end of the procedure it should tell you to record your data and find the difference in the masses .
1974	1	additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be to add more materials to the experiment . adding different kinds of pack could influence other materials in the experiment . another piece of information to be considered would be to increase the time the materials are soaked in the vinegar . this would probably have an increased affect on the materials . another piece of information would be to do more trials . this would help with pinpointing the exact affect vinegar has on these materials .
1975	1	the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment are a balance scale how much space in containers and how much mass used .
1976	1	i would add water because it would be less lighter than the rest of the stuff .
1977	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container how to determine the mass of the samples and what type of vinegar is being used . i would also need to know how to name and rinse each sample and how to dispose of the vinegar waste . lastly for is important to know the texture and distribution of each sample a container . for example if the limestone was crushed and poured in the vinegar container it would dissolve much faster .
1978	1	in order to replicate this experiment u would have to try use many different samples . another way they can do this is to be more pacific on the data by telling us how many cups of vine gen is needed .
1979	1	additional information we would need is the type of samples in order to replicate the experiment knowing how much vinegar to add in four separate identical containers would also need to know how to measure the samples masses . all this helps to replicate the experiment .
1980	1	to replicate a better experiment the first thing you would want to add is how much vinegar is poured in each container . if one container has more than the other more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results . another factor they may want to change to the same weight and size of the material once again isn t going to give you good results . lastly they shouldn t use the already used material to replicate the experiment . some materials are weaker than others and may erode quicker so those are all factors the group of students should add .
1981	1	the first piece of information that is necessary to repeat this experiment if only given the procedure is what the four samples are . we would also need to know how much vinegar to place in each container . we would also need to know if the containers needed to be opened or closed during the twenty four hour period .
1982	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know promptly the size of the sample used so that i would achieve similar results . i would also need to know the amount of vinegar poured into each of the four containers i need to know this because different amounts of vinegar may cause more or less of a change in mass . another thing that i would need to know is the environment that the samples are to sit in the temperature and lighting could effect my results . lastly i would need to know if the containers are covered or left open if they are left open some of the vinegar could eva ports thus effecting my results .
1983	1	they would need to explain how their experiment went . so they used different objects and put them in containers with vinegar to sob . determine the mass of each . so this is how they should explain their experiment . we ve tested four objects in vinegar and the four objects were a marble limestone wood and plastic . the mass of each were marble . limestone . wood . and plastic . . when we put them in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for minutes we saw that the mass of the marble went down to . limestone . wood . and plastic . . so the mass of the marble went down . limestone . wood . and plastic . .
1984	1	what additional information we will need is how much vinegar they used what kind of vinegar they used and how big and what kind of containers they used they should also have a control group plus they should tell for how big each sample is .
1985	1	in order to replicate this experiment the additional information that is needed is to record exactly how much vinegar needs to be poured into each container . another piece of additional information that is needed is how to determine the initial mass of each sample . it is also necessary to be specific and state exactly which material marble limestone wood or plastic should be placed into each container .
1986	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container you would need to know what the four different samples were and you would need to know whether or not to cover or put a lid on the containers .
1987	1	you need a grab for the chart .
1988	1	the procedure did not say what types of cocks should be used in this experiment . the procedure also does not state you much vinegar but in the cups . at the end of the procedure it should say repeat experiment for better results .
1989	1	they should have done more trials for each sample to make sure it is accurate . also there should be the same amount of vinegar for each sample . it should say put each sample in the same size containers and cover the sample with vinegar or say how much vinegar to use .
1990	1	firstly the students need to be clearer with their procedure . the amount of vinegar to pour on the samples can dramatically alter the results so an exact amount is desirable . how big are the containers the size matters when replicating . another necessity in replication of this experiment is the time used to rinse the samples they all must be the same
1991	1	how much of a sample to put in the container . also how much big were the containers and how much vinegar should be used
1992	1	should try different samples for each container . p another suggestion let it sit and dry for different time . p another make sure is the same temperature .
1993	1	i think that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure tell what we were getting the mass of also they should have once more trials each why this observation was being done .
1994	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would first need to know the amount of vinegar i needed to pour into the containers it would also be good to say what they are using to determine the mass of the i object whether it was a triple beam balance or an cedric balance finally in order to replicate the experiment they would need to tell me what the same are because it all know is four different sample i m not going to know they mean marble limestone wood and plastic .
1995	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use what form each sample is in and the type of vinegar that was used for the experiment .
1996	1	the additional information needed to replicate the experiment would first be how much vinegar to pour into the cups and the units in which to measure the rocks mass and vinegar . they would also have to include the purpose of the experiment so others understand the experiment better .
1997	1	in order to replicate the experiment more information could be needed . the procedure would that base to
1998	1	to be able to replicate the following experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container . i would also need to know what samples to use . where do i put the containers for hours .
1999	1	the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar that goes in each cup also the need to list the material and they need to add the mass object w .
2000	1	you would need to have a control to determine what you are doing the experiment for . the students would also need to have a dependant variable as well as a dependant variable . the students also need to state what they are testing in the experiment .
2001	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the four different samples were because they did not mention them in the procedure . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container i would need to know how big the containers were .
2002	1	the three different prices of information you would need is what samples are you using for the experiment . the second thing you would need to measure the mass on a scale before measuring it after the hours . and the third reason is subtract the starting mass from the ending mass to get the difference between them .
2003	1	some information i would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was used what to measure the mass of he samples with and how long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water .
2004	1	after reading the students procedure one thing i would add is the amount of vinegar to add to each sample . another thing i would add in the procedure is the size of the container they want the samples in and if they should be covered . the last thing i d have the students add to their procedure is the actual samples themselves so that the person can know what substances they are testing . if all those things were done the experiment would go a lot smoother and the results would be a lot more accurate .
2005	1	the information needed to replicate this experiment is to identify the different samples and how to make them . they would need to specify how much vinegar to pour into the containers also be more clear about the control in the experiment .
2006	1	the additional information you could add are how much of the vinegar do we add to the containers or what kind of vinegar to add because they don t say this in the procedure . also when to start they don t tell you when to start or to end they only said after hours remove the samples . they also don t tell you how or when to record the mass of the object they just say rinse containers and let them dry . also they need to run two more test .
2007	1	you would need to know the age of the samples because if the wood is old and dried out it ll absorb some of the vinegar .
2008	1	additional information the students should include ares . what is the problem they are trying to solve . list of materials . amount of vinegar .
2009	1	on order to replicate the experiment
2010	1	after reading the group s procedure the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment includes how much of each sample to use because without having the same amount of sample you don t know whether the mass difference is due to composition or amount the same applies to the vinegar without knowing how much vinegar to pour into the cups one might be affected more because it has more vinegar in it than the others . this can also apply to the distilled water without knowing how long to rinse or how much water to use one sample might be affected more .
2011	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know if there were any other factors while you left it sitting such as temperature . sunlight also you need to know the independent and dependant variable .
